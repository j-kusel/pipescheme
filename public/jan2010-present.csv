BRADLEY ATKINS (SOUTHEASTERN NATURAL GAS SERVICES OF ROME) WAS IN THE HOLE AND HAD A 2"" STEEL GAS LINE EXPOSED WITH A SHORT SECTION CUT OUT. AT THE TIME I ARRIVED HE STILL HAD GAS BLEEDING FROM THE SOUTH END OF THE LINE WHERE HE WAS WELDING ON SOMETHING AND GAS FROM THE NORTH END OF THE LINE WHICH WAS OPEN AND HAD BEEN SET ON FIRE. I SPOKE WITH BRADLEY AND HE TOLD ME HE THOUGHT THERE MUST BE ANOTHER FEED ON THE NORTH END OF THE LINE SO I TOLD HIM I WOULD SEE IF I COULD FIND WHERE IT WAS COMING FROM.   4:35 PM: I ASKED SHANE FERGUSON TO PULL THE BACKHOE TO A VALVE ABOUT 100 FEET NORTH OF THE HOLE WHERE THE LINE WAS EXPOSED. I WAS TOLD THAT SOMEONE HAD TRIED TO OPERATE THE VALVE AND THEY THOUGHT IT WAS STRIPED. I INSTRUCTED SHANE TO DIG THE VALVE UP. ONCE THE VALVE WAS EXPOSED I PUT A PIPE WRENCH ON THE VALVE TO SEE IF IT WOULD MOVE AND PARTIALLY OPERATED IT.   4:45 PM: I RETURNED TO THE HOLE WHERE THE LINE WAS EXPOSED AND SOMEONE TOLD ME BRADLEY HAD BEEN BURNED.  BRADLEY WAS OVER AT HIS TRUCK SO I WALKED OVER AND ASKED HIM IF HE WAS OK, HE SAID HE WAS FINE BUT I TOLD HIM HE NEEDED TO GET CHECKED OUT. BRADLEY WANTED HIS WIFE TO DRIVE HIM TO THE DOCTOR SO WHILE WE WERE WAITING BRADLEY GAVE ME INSTRUCTIONS TO GIVE TO LONNIE TANNER WHO WAS COMING TO FINISH THE JOB. I WROTE THE INSTRUCTIONS DOWN ON A PIECE OF PAPER.   5:15 PM:  BRADLEY LEFT FOR THE HOSPITAL WITH HIS WIFE.    5:20 PM:  AT THIS TIME WE PINCHED OFF THE LINE WHICH WAS STILL BURNING ON THE NORTH SECTION OF THE CUT OUT SECTION AND THE GAS HAD BLED OFF OF THE SOUTH END OF THE LINE. I WALKED OVER ACROSS HIGHWAY 140 TO THE REGULATOR STATION FEEDING SHAW TO SEE IF I COULD FIGURE OUT WHERE THE GAS WHICH WAS STILL ON THE NORTH END OF THE LINE WAS COMING FROM. AT THE REGULATOR STATION SOUTHEASTERN NATURAL GAS SERVICES OF ROME HAD TAKEN OUT A 1/4"" PLUG ON THE INLET SIDE OF REGULATOR WHICH WAS STILL BLEEDING GAS OFF THE LINE ON THE NORTH SECTION OF LINE. A 2"" VALVE ON THE OUTLET SIDE TO SHAW HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY TURNED OFF TRAPPING THE LINE PACK BETWEEN THE REGULATOR STATION AND SHAW WHICH IS ABOUT 350 FEET OF 4"" HDPE LINE.   5:35 PM:  I BLED THE GAS OFF ON THE SHAW SIDE OF REGULATOR STATION AND THE GAS ALSO STOPPED ON THE BLEEDING PLUG ON THE INLET SIDE SO THE GAS HAD BEEN BLEEDING BACK THROUGH A VALVE ON THE REGULATOR STATION. ALL THE GAS WAS OFF BOTH ENDS OF THE LINE BY 5:45 PM.  5:45 PM: WE WAITED FOR LONNIE TANNER TO ARRIVE.  6:15 PM:  LONNIE TANNER ARRIVED AND I GAVE HIM THE PAPER WITH THE INSTRUCTIONS WHICH BRADLEY HAD LEFT FOR HIM. LONNIE COMPLETED THE JOB PER THE INSTRUCTIONS.   7:30 PM:  AT THIS TIME I KNEW BRADLEY WAS ADMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL SO I CAME BACK TO THE OFFICE TO MAKE TELEPHONE CALLS.    7:35 PM:  I CALLED JEFF BAGGETT WITH GEORGIA PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION AND INFORMED HIM OF THE INCIDENT. 8:02 PM:  I CALLED THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER TO INFORM THEM OF THE INCIDENT.

ON DECEMBER 16, 2016, ON THE NORTHWEST CORNER OF THE INTERSECTION OF WEST KELLI AVE. AND HWY 62 (MAIN ST.) IN FARMINGTON, ARKANSAS, A VEHICLE TRAVELLING WEST ON HWY 62 LEFT THE ROADWAY AND STRUCK A BLACK HILLS ENERGY ARKANSAS, INC. (""BHEA"" OR THE ""COMPANY"") 2-INCH POST REGULATOR SETTING THAT WAS CONNECTED TO A 4-INCH TRANSMISSION PIPELINE.  THE REGULATOR SETTING WAS LOCATED 28.5 FEET FROM THE CURB OF HWY 62.  THE IMPACT OF THE CAR STRIKING THE SETTING BROKE TWO 2"" X 1"" SWAGES ON THE HIGH PRESSURE SIDE OF THE REGULATOR AND TWO 2"" STEEL PIPES ON THE INTERMEDIATE PRESSURE SIDE OF THE REGULATOR.  THE GAS ESCAPING FROM THE BROKEN PORTIONS OF THE REGULATOR SETTING IGNITED IMMEDIATELY, RESULTING IN A LARGE FIRE.  THE FIRST BHEA EMPLOYEES ARRIVED AT THE SCENE AT 4:00 P.M. AND 4:10 P.M., AND STARTED THE PROCESS OF ISOLATING THE EFFECTED SEGMENT OF THE COMPANY'S SYSTEM WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF THE FARMINGTON AND FAYETTEVILLE FIRE DEPARTMENTS.  THE EMERGENCY SHUT OFF VALVE FOR THE SETTING, WHICH WAS LOCATED 21 FEET FROM THE SETTING, WAS INACCESSIBLE DUE TO THE SIZE OF THE FIRE.   RATHER THAN STOP THE FIRE BY COMPLETELY SHUTTING OFF THE FLOW OF GAS TO THE PORTION OF BHEA'S SYSTEM IN THE AREA OF THE INCIDENT, WHICH WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN LOSS OF SERVICE TO HUNDREDS OF CUSTOMERS, BHEA DECIDED, BASED ON ALL OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT, TO TAKE MEASURES TO REDUCE OR STOP THE FLOW OF GAS TO THE ISOLATED PORTION OF ITS SYSTEM FEEDING INTO THE REGULATOR SETTING IN ORDER TO STOP THE FIRE WHILE AT THE SAME TIME AVOIDING LOSS OF SERVICE TO ITS CUSTOMERS.  THIS DECISION WAS MADE FOLLOWING DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN BHEA AND THE FIRE DEPARTMENTS THAT RESPONDED TO THE SCENE, DURING WHICH ALL PARTIES AGREED THAT THERE WERE NO IMPENDING RISKS TO HUMAN LIFE OR PROPERTY, SINCE THE PERSON THAT WAS APPARENTLY IN THE CAR THAT STRUCK THE REGULATOR SETTING WAS EITHER DECEASED PRIOR TO THE CAR HITTING THE SETTING OR DIED WHEN THE FIRE ERUPTED*, THE OCCUPANTS OF A NEARBY DUPLEX THAT HAD CAUGHT FIRE HAD BEEN SAFELY EVACUATED, AND NO OTHER LIVES WERE IN DANGER.  REGARDING PROPERTY, AS MENTIONED, A DUPLEX NEXT TO THE REGULATOR SETTING HAD CAUGHT FIRE ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE CAR HIT THE SETTING AND THE FIRE BEGAN, AND IT WAS QUICKLY APPARENT THAT IT COULD NOT BE SAVED FROM TOTAL LOSS.  THERE WAS NO OTHER IMMINENT RISK TO PROPERTY, GIVEN THE FIRE WAS UNDER CONTROL AND WAS NOT SPREADING.  IN ADDITION, BHEA WAS AWARE THAT THE WEATHER WAS FORECASTED TO TURN VERY COLD THE FOLLOWING DAY, WITH TEMPERATURES FORECASTED TO FALL INTO THE SINGLE DIGITS BY THE FOLLOWING NIGHT, MAKING ANY LOSS OF GAS SERVICE TO CUSTOMERS ALL THE MORE CONSEQUENTIAL.    BECAUSE GAS WAS FEEDING INTO THE SETTING FROM FOUR DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS, THE PROCESS OF ISOLATING THE FLOW OF GAS TO THE SETTING TOOK SEVERAL HOURS, AND WAS COMPLETED AT APPROXIMATELY 12:40 A.M. ON THE MORNING OF SATURDAY, DECEMBER 17.  AFTER THE FIRE DEPARTMENTS COMPLETED THEIR INVESTIGATION OF THE DAMAGED FACILITIES, BHEA BEGAN THE PROCESS OF REPLACING THE SETTING IN ORDER TO BRING THE SEGMENT OF THE SYSTEM BACK INTO SERVICE, WHICH TOOK PLACE AT 1:15 P.M. ON SATURDAY, DECEMBER 17.  *THERE WAS APPARENTLY ONE PERSON IN THE CAR AT THE TIME IT HIT THE REGULATOR SETTING.  FOLLOWING THE INCIDENT, BONE FRAGMENTS FROM THAT PERSON WERE FOUND IN THE CAR.  THE INCIDENT IS STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION, AND AS OF THE DATE OF THIS REPORT, NEITHER THE CAUSE OF DEATH, NOR THE TIME OF DEATH (EITHER BEFORE THE INCIDENT OR AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT) HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED.  UNTIL THE RESULTS OF THE RELEVANT AUTHORITIES' INVESTIGATIONS ARE RELEASED, BHEA HAS STATED ON THIS REPORT TO PHMSA THAT THERE WERE NO FATALITIES THAT RESULTED FROM THE INCIDENT.  BHEA WILL UPDATE THIS REPORT ONCE IT RECEIVES FURTHER INFORMATION."

PGW RESPONDED WITH PERSONNEL TO INVESTIGATE THE AREA. UPON ARRIVAL AND INVESTIGATION ON THE SCENE PGW FOUND HIGH CARBON MONOXIDE READINGS IN VARIOUS STRUCTURES AND HEAVY SMOKE COMING FROM TWO SEPTA MANHOLES. THE CAUSE OF THE SMOKE AND ODORS WERE DETERMINED TO BE CAUSED BY AN UNDERGROUND SHORT IN SEPTA ELECTRICAL LINES CAUSING A BURN OUT.

PGW EXCAVATED AND FOUND A LEAKING 4 INCH CAST IRON MAIN THAT CROSSED OVER TOP OF THE SEPTA DUCT.

ALL GAS WORK WAS PERFORMED BY ENOI GAS OPERATION PERSONNEL.  THE SCOPE OF WORK WAS TO CLOSE THE SERVICE VALVES SERVING THE PLANT, PURGE THE SERVICE LINES, CUT AND WELD A STEEL CAP ON BOTH THE UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM ENDS TO PROVIDE PHYSICAL SEPARATION. INITIAL WORK WAS ON THE 20 INCH LINE FEEDING MICHOUD UNITS 1 AND 2.  PRIMARY WORK ONSITE WAS:  1. EXCAVATING THE SERVICE TO GAIN ACCESS TO THE LINE.  EXCAVATION DIMENSIONS WERE APPROXIMATELY 8 FEET WIDE BY 15 FEET LONG BY 8 FEET DEEP TO ALLOW FOR COMPLETE 360ﾰ ACCESS TO SERVICE.  2. PURGING THE SERVICE LINE WITH INERT GAS, AND THEN GAPPING THE SERVICE TO ISOLATE THE DOWNSTREAM SEGMENT INTO THE PLANT.  3. WELDING STEEL CAPS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE NEW GAP.  4. OPENING THE SERVICE VALVE TO RE-PRESSURIZE THE SERVICE LINE UPSTREAM OF THE GAP.  WITHIN 3 MINUTES OF HAVING THE UPSTREAM VALVE FULLY OPEN, THE PRESSURE RELEASE OCCURRED (13:10 CST).  APPROXIMATELY 10 FEET UPSTREAM OF THE EXCAVATION, THE GAPPED SERVICE SEGMENT WAS BLOWN OUT OF A STRAPPED STYLE 40 DRESSER COUPLING.  THE SERVICE VALVE WAS CLOSED WITHIN 7 MINUTES.

WE LOCATED OUR FACILITIES FOR THE CONTRACTOR ON AUGUST 3, 2016.    WE WERE NOTIFIED BY THE CONTRACTOR ON AUGUST 4, 2016 AT 1342 THAT THEY HAD HIT ONE OF OUR GAS LINES AT THIS LOCATION AND IT WAS ON FIRE. THE FIRE DEPARTMENT ARRIVED ON THE SCENE AT 1347.  WE ARRIVED ON THE SCENE AT 1351 TO FIND A GAS SERVICE LINE HAD BEEN HIT AND WAS ON FIRE ALONG WITH THE CONTRACTOR'S MINI EXCAVATOR.     THE FIRE DEPARTMENT PROTECTED EXPOSURES IN THE AREA OF THE FIRE WHILE WE BEGAN TO SHUT DOWN THE SERVICE LINE. WE PINCHED THE SERVICE LINE OFF APPROXIMATELY 56 FEET FROM THE DAMAGED AREA TO EXTINGUISH THE FIRE AT 1417.  WE NOTIFIED THIS INCIDENT TO THE ALABAMA PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION AT 1423 AND TO THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER AT 1446 ON AUGUST 4, 2016.    WE TALKED WITH THE CONTRACTOR'S OPERATOR WHO WAS EXCAVATING THE HOLE AND HE REPORTED THAT THE GAS IGNITED AS SOON AS THE LINE WAS HIT. HE STATED THAT IT SINGED HIS ARM HAIR, BUT HE WAS NOT INJURED. WITH THE CONTRACTOR'S ASSISTANCE, WE REMOVED THE MINI EXCAVATOR'S BUCKET THAT WAS STILL IN THE APPROXIMATELY 6 1/2 FOOT LONG BY 3 FOOT WIDE EXCAVATION TO SEE THE EXTENT OF THE DAMAGE. WE OBSERVED THAT THE BUCKET HAD COMPLETELY SEVERED THE 3/4 INCH PE GAS SERVICE LINE AND THE 3/4 INCH CONDUIT CONTAINING ELECTRICAL WIRES TO THE PARKING LOT LIGHTS. ALSO LOCATED IN THE HOLE WERE TWO 3/4 INCH PVC SPRINKLER LINE WITH CONTROL WIRES, A 3/4 INCH CONDUIT CONTAINING ELECTRICAL WIRES, AND A 2 INCH CONDUIT CONTAINING TELECOMMUNICATION WIRES WHICH WERE NOT DAMAGED.     WE MEASURED THE DISTANCE OF THE GAS SERVICE LINE FROM LOCATE MARKS IN TWO LOCATIONS TO DETERMINE IF THE LINE WAS LOCATED WITHIN THE TOLERANCE ZONE OF THE LOCATE MARKS. THE METHOD WE USED TO DETERMINE THIS WAS WE PULLED A TAPE MEASURE FROM THE LOCATE MARK ON THE PARKING LOT CURB NEXT TO THE EXCAVATION AND LOCATE MARK BETWEEN THE EXCAVATION AND THE ROAD. WE PULLED ANOTHER TAPE 90ﾰ OFF THAT TAPE AND MEASURED TO THE CENTER LINE OF THE GAS SERVICE LINE IN TWO LOCATIONS. THE SERVICE LINE DISTANCE AT THE FIRST LOCATION, CLOSEST TO THE PARKING LOT CURB, WAS 23 3/8 INCHES AND THE DISTANCE AT THE OPPOSITE END OF THE DITCH WAS 21 INCHES FROM THE LOCATE MARK. FROM THESE MEASUREMENTS IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE SERVICE LINE LOCATION WAS NOT IN THE TOLERANCE ZONE OF THE LOCATE MARKS. THE SERVICE LINE WAS BURIED 15 1/2 INCHES FROM THE TOP OF GROUND TO THE TOP OF THE SERVICE LINE.     AFTER FINAL INVESTIGATION, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT SEVERAL FURTHER STEPS IN LOCATING AND EXCAVATION COULD HAVE BEEN PERFORMED TO HELP MITIGATE THE RISK OF DAMAGE TO THE GAS SERVICE LINE:    1.  DURING THE LOCATING PROCESS INSTEAD OF INDUCING A SIGNAL TO LOCATE THE SERVICE, A DIRECT CONNECTION COULD HAVE BEEN PERFORMED         TO INDUCE A LOWER FREQUENCY, POSSIBLY REDUCING THE CHANCES OF INTERFERENCE BY THE OTHER UTILITIES IN THE AREA.    2.  THE SIGNAL COULD HAVE BEEN "" BALANCED"" TO VERIFY THERE WAS A SYMMETRICAL MAGNETIC FIELD FOR THE SERVICE LINE.    3.  THE CONTRACTOR COULD HAVE UTILIZED A NON-INVASIVE EXCAVATION METHOD TO DETERMINE THE PRECISE LOCATION OF THE GAS SERVICE LINE          BECAUSE MECHANIZED EQUIPMENT WAS BEING UTILIZED WITHIN THE TOLERANCE ZONE OF THE LOCATE MARKS."

ACCORDING TO INTERVIEWS CONDUCTED BY THE ASHLAND FIRE DEPARTMENT OF EMPLOYEES AT THE PROPERTY, AS WELL AS PATRONS OF THE STORE PRIOR TO THE INCIDENT, A CHEMICAL ODOR, NOT NATURAL GAS, WAS SMELLED ON SITE.    A  COLUMBIA SERVICE TECHNICIAN WAS ON SITE TO SET A GAS METER AT THE GAS STATION THE DAY PRIOR TO THE EXPLOSION, MAY 2, 2016.  COLUMBIA'S TECHNICIAN FOUND THE SERVICE LINE CURB VALVE IN THE ""OFF"" POSITION WHEN HE ARRIVED ON SITE. THE TECHNICIAN TURNED THE CURB VALVE TO THE ""ON"" POSITION BRIEFLY TO DETERMINE IF THE GAS SERVICE WAS ACTIVE, AND PROMPTLY TURNED THE CURB VALVE BACK TO THE ""OFF"" POSITION WHEN NO GAS WAS FOUND AT THE METER SETTING. THE CURB VALVE'S ""OFF"" POSITION WAS VERIFIED WHEN EXCAVATED FOLLOWING THE INCIDENT.    FOLLOWING THE INCIDENT, ON MAY 3, 2016, THE CURB VALVE AND THE CUSTOMER-OWNED SERVICE LINE WERE EXPOSED AND IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE SERVICE LINE DOWNSTREAM OF THE CURB VALVE HAD BEEN SEVERED PRIOR TO THE MAY 2, 2016 SITE VISIT BY COLUMBIA.

THE ROOT CAUSE WAS OVERPRESSURIZATION OF THE GAS SERVICE  REGULATOR SUPPLYING COOKING LOADS TO 152 APARTMENTS, DUE TO IMPROPER INSTALLATION OF THE VENT LINES AT THE TIME OF THE INITIAL INSTALLATION.  THIS WAS A PARALLEL GAS SERVICE REGULATOR INSTALLATION. PART OF THE VENT LINES WERE INSTALLED BELOW GRADE, PASSING THROUGH TWO CONCRETE BARRIERS:  ONE AT FOUNDATION WALL, AND ONE AT SIDEWALK.  THESE VENT LINES WERE BOTH UNSLEEVED, AND CORRODED OVER TIME.  WATER FROM THE SURROUNDING SOIL INFILTRATED THE VENT LINE AND COLLECTED ON TOP OF THE PRIMARY REGULATOR DIAPHRAGM AND FROZE. IN ADDITION, THE VENT LINE WAS PARTIALLY FROZEN AND BLOCKED. THE SECONDARY REGULATOR SERVED TO VENT EXCESS GAS DUE TO ELEVATED PRESSURE. A SERVICE PERSON RESPONDING TO A CALL AT THIS LOCATION FOUND THE COUPLING ON THE SECONDARY VENT LINE DISCONNECTED, AND OUT OF AN ABUNDANCE OF CAUTION, ""VALVED OUT"" THE SECONDARY REGULATOR TO STOP THE FLOW OF BLOWING GAS.  THIS PREVENTED THE INTERNAL RELIEF OF THE SECONDARY GAS SERVICE REGULATOR TO VENT THE EXCESS PRESSURE FROM THE FAILED REGULATOR; THEREFORE BOTH RELIEF VALVES WERE RENDERED INEFFECTIVE, ALLOWING DOWNSTREAM PRESSURE TO BUILD UP TO LEVELS BEYOND RECOMMENDED LIMITS FOR THE CUSTOMERS' EQUIPMENT AND A FIRE RESULTED IN ONE OF THE APARTMENTS.  COOKING LOADS FOR ALL 152 APARTMENTS REMAIN TURNED OFF UNTIL THE ASSIGNED PLUMBER OBTAINS THE PERMIT FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF BUILDINGS.    IN PART G ABOVE, THE TASK WHICH LED TO THE INCIDENT WAS NOT A COVERED TASK FOR OUR OQ PROGRAM AT THE TIME OF THE SERVICE AND EQUIPMENT INSTALLATION; HOWEVER, IT IS A COVERED TASK AT THIS POINT IN TIME.

THE WELDER 1 (INJURED EMPLOYEE) ON THE CREW RETIRED THE SERVICE BY CUTTING THE SERVICE ABOUT 4 INCHES FROM THE TAPPING TEE WITH A SET OF FOUR WHEEL CUTTERS, AND THEN INSERTED A LEAK SCREW IN THE SERVICE, AND WELDED IT UP.  AFTER WELDING THE LEAK SCREW IN, THEY CHECKED FOR LEAKS AND NO LEAKS WERE FOUND. WELDER 1 (INJURED EMPLOYEE) THEN BUFFED THE TEE AND MAIN OFF WITH A BUFFER TO PREPARE IT TO BE RE-COATED AND CHECKED FOR LEAKS A SECOND TIME. AFTER CHECKING FOR LEAKS AGAIN WELDER 1 (INJURED EMPLOYEE) FOUND A SMALL LEAK ON THE TAPPING TEE. WELDER 1 (INJURED EMPLOYEE) TRIED TO WELD THE LEAK UP BUT WAS UNSUCCESSFUL. AFTER FAILING TO REPAIR THE LEAK ON THE TAPPING TEE THE CREW FORMAN INSTRUCTED WELDER 1 (INJURED EMPLOYEE) TO REMOVE THE TAPPING TEE AND INSTALL A LEAK SCREW IN THE MAIN TO ELIMINATE THE LEAK. WELDER 1 (INJURED EMPLOYEE) USED AN ELECTRIC BAND SAW TO CUT THE TEE OFF THE MAIN. WHILE CUTTING THE TEE OFF THE MAIN THE GAS IGNITED, AND WELDER 1 (INJURED EMPLOYEE) ESCAPED OUT OF THE HOLE WHILE RECEIVING BURNS TO HIS LEFT ARM, NECK, AND FACE.  IN THE PRECONSTRUCTION MEETING, THE GAS DISTRIBUTION/CONSTRUCTION SUPERINTENDENT INSTRUCTED THE CREW FORMAN NOT TO USE THE ELECTRIC BAND SAW WHILE RETIRING THIS SERVICE. THE DISTRIBUTION/CONSTRUCTION SUPERINTENDENT TOLD THE CREW FORMAN THIS WHILE GIVING INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE DAY OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2015. THE REGULATORY COMPLIANCE SUPERVISOR WAS A WITNESS TO THIS CONVERSATION.   AT 11:26AM THE CREW FORMAN CALLED THE REGULATORY COMPLIANCE SUPERVISOR AND TOLD HIM THAT WELDER 1 THE INJURED EMPLOYEE HAD RECEIVED BURNS AND THE REGULATORY COMPLIANCE SUPERVISOR ARRIVED WITHIN FIVE MINUTES, AND TOOK WELDER 1 (INJURED EMPLOYEE) TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM. SERVICE WORKER A CALLED WELDER 2 WHO ARRIVED WITH IN TWENTY MINUTES TO THE JOB SITE. WELDER 2 INSTALLED AND WELDED A LEAK SCREW IN THE MAIN TO STOP THE FLOW OF GAS. GAS WAS RELEASED FOR NO MORE THAN TWENTY MINUTES.   AT APPROXIMATELY 12:05PM IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE INJURED EMPLOYEE WOULD NEED HOSPITALIZATION AND WAS TRANSFERRED TO GRADY HOSPITAL IN ATLANTA AROUND 1:30PM.  THE INJURED EMPLOYEE WAS HOSPITALIZED, NO PROPERTY DAMAGE, AND NO EVACUATIONS.  THE REGULATORY COMPLIANCE SUPERVISOR CONTACTED CHRIS SWAN WITH THE PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION AT 12:39PM AS PER COMMISSION RULE.  THE REGULATORY COMPLIANCE SUPERVISOR CONTACTED THE OFFICE OF PIPELINE SAFETY NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER AT 1:50PM AND REPORTED THE INCIDENT. THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER GAVE THE REGULATORY COMPLIANCE SUPERVISOR A CONFIRMATION NUMBER OF:  1129766.  PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION INSPECTOR LYNN BUFFINGTON ARRIVED AT OUR OFFICE AT 2:20PM TO INVESTIGATE THE INCIDENT.

BASED ON THE INFORMATION PRESENTLY AVAILABLE, IT IS THE OPINION OF THIS INVESTIGATOR THAT THE SOURCE OF IGNITION WAS UNDETERMINED. THERE WAS A SEVERED NATURAL GAS PIPE INSIDE OF THE GARAGE AND GAS WAS FREE FLOWING INSIDE OF THE GARAGE, WHICH PROVIDED THE FUEL FOR THE IGNITION. THE AREA OF ORIGIN CONTAINED MULTIPLE COMPETENT AND POTENTIAL SOURCES OF ACCIDENTAL IGNITION. THESE INCLUDED ENERGIZED ELECTRICAL DEVICES. AS A RESULT, THE SPECIFIC SOURCE OF IGNITION OF THIS FIRE COULD NOT BE CONCLUSIVELY DETERMINED WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THIS INVESTIGATION. DURING THIS INVESTIGATION, HOWEVER, NO SOURCES OF INCENDIARY IGNITION WERE OBSERVED OR INDICATED IN THE AREA OF ORIGIN. IT IS THE OPINION OF THIS INVESTIGATOR THAT THE EXPLOSION AND FIRE WAS ACCIDENTAL IN NATURE."

THE HOMEOWNER INDICATED A LIGHTNING STRIKE OCCURRED AT APPROXIMATELY 07:34 AND AFTERWARDS A STRONG ODOR OF GAS WAS PRESENT NEAR THE HOME.  THE RESPONDING GAS SERVICE WORKER (GSW) PERFORMED A SERIES OF LEAK TEST AT 10223 DODGE RD., INCLUDING BAR HOLE TESTING THE SERVICE LINE AND THE MAIN.  NO  GAS READS WERE DETECTED AT THIS LOCATION.     THE GSW PROCEEDED TO CHECK FOR GAS READINGS ALONG THE SERVICE LINE AS WELL AS THE BUILDING PERIMETER (DOORS AND WINDOWS) AT 10218 DODGE RD. USING A SENSIT GOLD CGI COMBUSTIBLE GAS INDICATOR.  NO READS WERE DETECTED DURING THIS PORTION OF THE INVESTIGATION.    THE GSW EXPANDED THE LEAK INVESTIGATION TO THE LIGHTNING STRIKE LOCATION AT 10209 DODGE RD., AND FOUND 100% GAS READS AT THE EDGE OF PAVEMENT ON BOTH SIDES OF DODGE ROAD AS WELL AS WATER BUBBLING FROM A CRACK IN THE PAVEMENT NEAR THE CENTER OF THE ROAD ABOVE THE SERVICE LINE.

THE PROPERTY WAS UNOCCUPIED AND NO INJURIES OCCURRED AS A RESULT OF THE INCIDENT.     AFTER THE INCIDENT, CONSUMERS ENERGY CONDUCTED BAR HOLE TESTING IN THE VICINITY OF 10218 DODGE ROAD.   THIS TESTING INDICATED THAT GAS HAD MIGRATED FROM THE LEAK LOCATION AT 10209 DODGE ROAD ALONG THE MAIN TO A LOCATION APPROXIMATELY 20' WEST OF THE IDENTIFIED LEAK.   THE HIGHEST SUSTAINED READS WERE OBTAINED APPROXIMATELY 20 FEET FROM THE LEAK LOCATION AND APPROXIMATELY 60 FEET FROM THE BUILDING WALL.  THE INITIAL READ TAKEN AT 16:00, APPROXIMATELY 3.5 HOURS AFTER THE EXPLOSION WAS 55%.  A READ TAKEN AT THE SAME LOCATION 2 HOURS LATER (22%) INDICATES THE MIGRATING GAS WAS VENTING AT THIS LOCATION.  THIS LOCATION WAS MONITORED THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS AND CONTINUED TO VENT. LOWER RESIDUAL GAS READINGS WERE ALSO OBTAINED, BUT AT NO TIME (PRE OR POST-INCIDENT) WERE THERE ANY GAS READINGS AT THE BUILDING WALL OF 10218 DODGE ROAD.      BASED ON THE INCIDENT INVESTIGATION SUMMARIZE ABOVE AND OUR INABILITY TO PERFORM AN INVESTIGATION OF THE CUSTOMER'S FUEL LINE AND GAS APPLIANCE(S), CONSUMERS ENERGY FOUND NO CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE THAT THE EXPLOSION AND FIRE AT 10218 DODGE RD., WAS THE RESULT OF A RELEASE  AND/OR MIGRATION OF CONSUMERS ENERGY'S JURISDICTIONAL GAS."

BETWEEN 2115 AND 2130, THE MACHINE STRUCK A HAWAII GAS (""HG"") UNDERGROUND MAIN LINE, CAUSING AN APPROXIMATELY 9.5-INCH TEAR IN THE MAIN.  THE DAMAGED SEGMENT WAS 4-INCH STEEL PIPE COATED WITH XTC (""SUBJECT SEGMENT""). THE SUBJECT SEGMENT BEGAN TO LEAK GAS AND AT AN UNVERIFIED TIME, THE GAS IGNITED AROUND THE MACHINE. TWO RB EMPLOYEES WERE INJURED IN CONNECTION WITH THE FIRE AND ONE REQUIRED INPATIENT HOSPITALIZATION. THE HONOLULU FIRE DEPARTMENT (""HFD"") RESPONDED AND DIRECTED WATER AT THE MACHINE TO PREVENT ITS FUEL TANKS FROM OVERHEATING. HG STOPPED THE FLOW OF GAS TO THE SUBJECT SEGMENT AT APPROXIMATELY 0253 ON 06/16/2015, THE FIRE DISSIPATED SHORTLY THEREAFTER AND HFD ANNOUNCED AN ""ALL CLEAR"" AT APPROXIMATELY 0300.    HG PRE-INCIDENT ACTIVITY    HG INSTALLED THE SUBJECT SEGMENT IN 1977. ON 02/09/2015, RB SUBMITTED ONE CALL TICKET 15001196 (THE ""TICKET"") TO THE HAWAII ONE CALL CENTER STATING THAT RB WOULD BE EXCAVATING AN AREA OF KAPAHULU AVENUE (THE ""EXCAVATION AREA""), INCLUDING THE SUBJECT SEGMENT. HG RESPONDED TO THE TICKET BY REVIEWING EXCAVATION AREA MAPS AND DETERMINING THAT AN UNDERGROUND MAIN WAS LOCATED THEREIN. ON 02/19/2015, HG PERFORMED CONDUCTIVE AND INDUCTIVE TONING IN THE EXCAVATION AREA AND MARKED THE APPROXIMATE LOCATION OF THE MAIN LINE ON THE ROADWAY SURFACE WITH YELLOW PAINT.    HG RESPONSE TO INCIDENT    HG WAS ALERTED TO THE INCIDENT IN TWO WAYS: 1) THE HG SYNTHETIC NATURAL GAS PLANT RECORDED A PRESSURE IRREGULARITY IN THE GAS PIPELINE AND NOTIFIED HG DISPATCH AT APPROXIMATELY 2130; AND 2) HFD NOTIFIED HG DISPATCH AT APPROXIMATELY 2138. AN HG OPERATIONS SUPERINTENDENT ARRIVED AT THE SCENE AT APPROXIMATELY 2200. OTHER HG PERSONNEL WERE NOTIFIED BETWEEN 2145 AND 2215, AND BEGAN ARRIVING AT THE HG KAMAKEE BASEYARD BETWEEN 2215 AND 2300. THE HG SUPERVISORY TEAM CONCLUDED THAT THE MAIN LINE WOULD NEED TO BE EXCAVATED AND STOPPED AT THREE LOCATIONS: NORTH, SOUTH AND WEST OF THE INCIDENT. HG PERSONNEL INSTALLED LINE STOPPERS AT THE NORTH AND SOUTH SITES AND PINCHED THE LINE AT THE WEST SITE. GAS FLOW TO THE SUBJECT SEGMENT WAS STOPPED AT APPROXIMATELY 0253 ON 06/16/15.    STATUTORY AND REGULATORY CONTEXT    (1) HAWAII ONE CALL STATUTE    THE HAWAII ONE CALL STATUTE REQUIRES AN EXCAVATOR TO PROVIDE EXCAVATION LOCATION TO THE ONE CALL CENTER PRIOR TO EXCAVATING, AND THE CENTER NOTIFIES UTILITY OPERATORS ABOUT THE PROPOSED EXCAVATION. THE OPERATOR LOCATES AND MARKS ON THE ROADWAY THE APPROXIMATE LOCATION OF INSTALLATIONS THAT MAY BE AFFECTED BY THE EXCAVATION, BUT IS NOT REQUIRED TO MARK DEPTH UNDER THE STATUTE. THE EXCAVATOR MUST THEN USE HAND TOOLS TO DETERMINE THE EXACT LOCATION OF THE INSTALLATION. HERE, HG RESPONDED TO THE TICKET BY REVIEWING MAPS, PERFORMING TONING AND MARKING THE ALIGNMENT--BUT NOT DEPTH--OF THE GAS MAIN IN THE EXCAVATION AREA WITH YELLOW PAINT. HG WAS IN FULL COMPLIANCE WITH THE ONE CALL STATUTE. RB DOES NOT APPEAR TO HAVE HAND EXCAVATED AND LOCATED THE SUBJECT SEGMENT IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE STATUTE.    (2) SUBJECT SEGMENT DEPTH    FEDERAL REGULATIONS IN 1977 REQUIRED 24-INCH COVER FOR A MAIN LINE. A MAIN LINE CAN BE INSTALLED WITH LESS THAN 24-INCH COVER IF AN UNDERGROUND STRUCTURE PREVENTS SUCH INSTALLATION AND THE LINE IS PROVIDED WITH ADDITIONAL PROTECTION. ON 06/16/2015, THE SUBJECT SEGMENT WAS MEASURED AT APPROXIMATELY 8 INCHES BELOW THE ROADWAY SURFACE. IF THE SUBJECT SEGMENT WAS INSTALLED WITH LESS THAN 24-INCH COVER IN 1977, THE ABOVE EXCEPTION APPLIES. CITY RECORDS INDICATE THAT A CONDUIT STRUCTURE RUNS DIRECTLY BELOW THE SUBJECT SEGMENT, PREVENTING INSTALLATION OF THE SUBJECT SEGMENT AT 24-INCH DEPTH. THE SUBJECT SEGMENT WAS ENCASED IN CONCRETE, PROVIDING THE ADDITIONAL PROTECTION REQUIRED FOR MAINS INSTALLED WITH LESS THAN 24-INCH COVER.

(""COLUMBIA"" OR ""COMPANY"") SERVICE TECHNICIAN RESPONDED TO AN ODOR-OF-GAS CALL AT 3418 SUNNINGDALE WAY, UPPER ARLINGTON, OHIO. THE TECHNICIAN VERIFIED THAT NO ONE WAS AT HOME, AND TURNED OFF BOTH THE CURB VALVE TO THE ACTIVE SERVICE LINE AND THE METER VALVE. NO LEAKS WERE FOUND IN THE METER SET ASSEMBLY, BUT SUBSURFACE READINGS INDICATED THE PRESENCE OF GAS AT THE FOUNDATION OF THE HOUSE.     WHILE THE TECHNICIAN WAS ON THE PREMISES, AN EXPLOSION OCCURRED, FOLLOWED BY A FIRE. THE FIRE CONTINUED AT THE FOUNDATION OF THE HOUSE. ALTHOUGH THE FIRE APPEARED TO BE GAS-FED, IT CONTINUED AFTER THE COMPANY PHYSICALLY DISCONNECTED THE ACTIVE, PLASTIC SERVICE LINE. IN THE COURSE OF SEARCHING FOR POSSIBLE SOURCES OF THE FIRE, THE COMPANY DISCOVERED A DISCONTINUED CUSTOMER-OWNED STEEL SERVICE LINE, WHICH WAS ACCESSED THROUGH A CURB BOX THAT WAS INCORRECTLY LABELED ""WATER."" THE VALVE ON THAT LINE WAS PARTIALLY OPEN, AND THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT IT WAS INADVERTENTLY OPERATED BY A THIRD PARTY ON THE PREVIOUS DAY. THE LINE TERMINATED AT AN ELBOW APPROXIMATELY 38 INCHES BELOW THE SURFACE, NEAR THE BLOCK FOUNDATION OF THE HOUSE. SUBSEQUENT TESTING SHOWED A CORROSION LEAK APPROXIMATELY FOUR FEET FROM THE INCORRECTLY LABELED CURB BOX, AND ADDITIONAL EXAMINATION OF THAT FACILITY REVEALED THAT THE ELBOW AT THE TERMINATION OF THE DISCONTINUED CUSTOMER-OWNED SERVICE LINE WAS UNCAPPED. COLUMBIA'S RECORDS DO NOT SHOW TWO SERVICE LINES AT THIS ADDRESS, AND SUBSEQUENT GAS MAIN CAMERA INSPECTIONS, INCLUDING GAS LINE VALVES AND CUSTOMER SERVICE CONNECTIONS TO THE MAIN, CONDUCTED BY COLUMBIA ON SUNNINGDALE WAY AND THE IMMEDIATELY SURROUNDING STREETS CONFIRMED THAT THE DISCONTINUED AND CONNECTED GAS SERVICE LINE IS AN ANOMALY BECAUSE ALL OTHER GAS MAIN OPENINGS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE COMPANY'S RECORDS. THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO RULE OUT AN UNAUTHORIZED INSTALLATION OF FACILITIES BY A THIRD PARTY.     AT THIS POINT IN THE INVESTIGATION, COLUMBIA HAS ENOUGH INFORMATION TO FINALIZE ITS INCIDENT REPORT, AND SUBMITS THAT THE INADVERTENT OPERATION OF A GAS VALVE BY A THIRD-PARTY, WHICH WAS ACCESSED THROUGH A CURB BOX THAT WAS INCORRECTLY LABELED ""WATER,"" WHICH ULTIMATELY ALLOWED GAS TO FLOW TO A DISCONTINUED, UNCAPPED SERVICE LINE IS THE LIKELY SERIES OF EVENTS THAT CAUSED THE INCIDENT.      THE COMPANY HAS MADE MULTIPLE ATTEMPTS TO INTERVIEW THE WATER DEPARTMENT AND/OR THE OPERATOR OF ITS SYSTEM IN THAT AREA TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT HAS INFORMATION OR DOCUMENTATION CONCERNING ANY FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTED TO THIS EVENT, AND HAS BEEN UNSUCCESSFUL IN SECURING AN INTERVIEW.

BEFORE THEY REACHED CYPRESS LANE, THE CREW WAS FLAGGED DOWN BY A POLICE OFFICER AT THE INTERSECTION OF OAK AVENUE AND ROUTE 9, WHO INFORMED THEM THAT THERE WAS A GAS ODOR ON OAK AVENUE. THEREAFTER, AT 9:15 A.M. A FIRST RESPONDER WAS DISPATCHED TO OAK AVENUE AND ARRIVED AT ABOUT 9:24 A.M. A STRONG GAS ODOR WAS IDENTIFIED NEAR 59 OAK AVENUE. IT WAS CONFIRMED THAT NO ONE WAS IN THE BUILDING. POLICE AND FIRE PERSONNEL WERE ALREADY ON SITE AND HAD EVACUATED NEIGHBORING HOMES.  SOON THEREAFTER, THREE ADDITIONAL CREWS ARRIVED AT 59 OAK AVENUE. A LEAK IN THE STREET WAS LOCATED AND THE CREWS BEGAN JACKHAMMERING THE PAVEMENT. AT 10:32 A.M., AN EXPLOSION OCCURRED INSIDE 59 OAK AVENUE. PRIOR TO THE INCIDENT APPROXIMATELY FIVE INDIVIDUALS WERE EVACUATED BY FIRE AND POLICE. A REQUEST FOR EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE WAS MADE IMMEDIATELY. SEVEN NJNG EMPLOYEES WERE TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL. FIVE WERE TREATED AND RELEASED AND TWO WERE ADMITTED. THE AREA WAS MADE SAFE AT 11:30 A.M. BY SHUTTING A VALVE TO THE STREET, WHICH AFFECTED ABOUT 335 CUSTOMERS. AT 14:30 (2:30 P.M.), NJNG RECEIVED PERMISSION TO RE-ENTER THE AREA AND REMOVE DEBRIS. THE STREET WAS OPENED IN THE LOCATION WHERE THE LEAK WAS FOUND AND A TWO-INCH (2"") COATED STEEL MAIN WAS FOUND TO BE BROKEN AT THE WELD JOINT. THE BREAK WAS 360ﾰ AROUND THE PIPE AND THE PIPE ENDS WERE SEPARATED. APPROXIMATELY TWO FEET OF PIPE ON EACH SIDE OF THE BREAK WAS REMOVED FOR METALLURGICAL EVALUATION.   NJNG BELIEVES THAT THERE WERE THREE PRIMARY CONTRIBUTING CAUSES FOR THE FAILURE:  (I) A POOR QUALITY WELD, LACKING ADEQUATE PENETRATION; (II) ENVIRONMENTALLY ASSISTED CRACKING OF THE WELD (E.G., CORROSION); AND (III) EXTERNAL STRESS ON THE GAS MAIN, POSSIBLY FROM POST-INSTALLATION IMPACT, DIFFERENTIAL SOIL SETTLEMENT BELOW THE PIPE, SOIL DISPLACEMENT FROM ADJACENT CONSTRUCTION, ETC.     WITH REFERENCE TO QUESTION NUMBER 2 IN PART D ABOVE, PLEASE BE ADVISED THAT NJNG HAS RECEIVED NUMEROUS PROPERTY DAMAGE CLAIMS, INCLUDING THE OWNER OF 59 OAK AVENUE, IN THE AMOUNT OF $199,000 AND SEVEN NEIGHBORING PROPERTIES, TOTALING APPROXIMATELY $75,000.  THE COMPANY HAS RECEIVED NOTICE OF OTHER CLAIMS FROM OTHER INSURANCE CARRIERS BUT THESE CARRIERS HAVE NOT INDICATED A LOSS AMOUNT.  THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT THE COMPANY ULTIMATELY PAYS ON THESE CLAIMS WILL DEPEND ON A FINDING OF LIABILITY AGAINST THE COMPANY AS WELL AS WHETHER THE AMOUNT OF THE DAMAGES CLAIMED CAN BE PROVEN BY THE CLAIMANT AND VERIFIED BY THE COMPANY.   A NEW PLASTIC MAIN WAS INSTALLED AND PRESSURIZED ON FEBRUARY 25, 2015 AT APPROXIMATELY 4:30 A.M. SERVICE WAS RESTORED TO ALL CUSTOMERS ON FEBRUARY 25, 2015 BY 18:30 (6:30 P.M.).

AFTER THE RELIEF VALVE OPENED, THE VALVE FAILED TO RE-SEAT DUE TO A PIECE OF WELD SLAG ON THE SEAT OF THE RELIEF.  IN RESPONSE TO THE INCIDENT, CREWS SHUT THE INLET VALVE TO THE REGULATOR STATION, HOWEVER THE RELIEF CONTINUED TO VENT DUE TO THE SLAG ON SEAT OF THE RELIEF.  THE ISSUE WAS RESOLVED AT APPROXIMATELY 8:59 AM WHEN THE OUTLET VALVE TO THE STATION WAS CLOSED.    THE INCIDENT IS BEING REPORTED ON THE BASIS OF THE VOLUMETRIC REPORTING CRITERIA.    SUBSEQUENT TO THE INCIDENT, AND BEFORE RETURNING THE STATION TO SERVICE, A DEDICATED FILTER WAS PLACED IN FRONT OF THE REGULATORS TO THE INSTRUMENT GAS TO MINIMIZE THE PROBABILITY OF RE-OCCURRENCE.

INCIDENT DESCRIPTION:  ON SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 8, 2014, MILLER PIPELINE CORP., A CONTRACTOR PERFORMING WORK FOR ATMOS ENERGY LOUISIANA DIVISION, WAS SCHEDULED TO DEACTIVATE AND ABANDON A 4"" PE GAS LINE ON HWY 21 @ N. AZALEA IN COVINGTON, LA. THIS WAS A COOL DAY WITH LOW HUMIDITY.    MILLER PIPELINE EMPLOYEE ANTHONY DUNCAN (CREW FOREMAN) WAS IN CHARGE OF THIS WORK AND WAS QUALIFIED IN THE ASSOCIATED OQ TASKS.  - ALL LINE STOPPERS UTILIZED TO BLOCK THE SOURCE OF GAS WERE INSTALLED PREVIOUSLY.  - BEFORE BEGINNING THE PURGING PROCESS, MR. DUNCAN CHECKED TO MAKE SURE ALL SOURCES OF GAS WERE BLOCKED FROM THE GAS LINE TO BE DEACTIVATED.  - AFTER CONFIRMATION THAT ALL SOURCES OF GAS WERE BLOCKED, MR. DUNCAN PROCEEDED TO OPEN THE VALVE (ON PURGE RISER) TO BEGIN DE-PRESSURING AND BLOWING DOWN THE GAS FROM THE LINE. HE WAITED 15 - 20 MINUTES FOR THE LINE TO BLOW DOWN.  - ONCE HE THOUGHT THE LINE WAS COMPLETELY BLOWN DOWN, MR. DUNCAN GOT IN THE EXCAVATION TO REMOVE THE BLOW DOWN RISER. HE USED 2-INCH PLASTIC CUTTERS TO PERFORM THIS TASK. IT WAS DURING THIS PROCESS THAT THE RESIDUAL GAS IN THE PIPE IGNITED AND A FLASH FIRE OCCURRED INJURING MR. DUNCAN.  - MR. DUNCAN WAS TRANSPORTED TO THE HOSPITAL WHERE HE WAS HELD OVERNIGHT FOR TREATMENT AND OBSERVATION.    CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT:  IT SEEMS THE PRIMARY CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT WAS THE GAS LINE TO BE ABANDONED WAS NOT PURGED OF GAS PROPERLY, ALLOWING RESIDUAL GAS TO REMAIN IN THE LINE. SECONDLY, PRECAUTIONS TO PREVENT ACCIDENTAL IGNITION WERE NOT FOLLOWED BY NOT PROPERLY GROUNDING THE PIPE OR TOOLS PRIOR TO CUTTING THE PURGE RISER. STATIC ELECTRICITY SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN THE SOURCE OF IGNITION OF THE RESIDUAL GAS. THIRDLY, MR. DUNCAN WAS NOT WEARING THE PROPER PPE (PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT) FIRE RETARDANT CLOTHING/GLOVES. THIS ADDED PROTECTION COULD HAVE MINIMIZED THE EXTENT OF THE INJURIES. FOURTHLY, MR. DUNCAN SENT HIS HELPER (ON FIRE WATCH) AWAY TO PERFORM ANOTHER JOB DUTY. BY HAVING SOMEONE ON FIRE WATCH AT THE EXCAVATION WITH A FIRE EXTINGUISHER COULD ALSO HAVE MINIMIZED THE EXTENT OF THE INJURIES, BY EITHER EXTINGUISHING THE FIRE RIGHT AWAY OR PULLING MR. DUNCAN OUT OF THE EXCAVATION AND AWAY FROM THE FIRE.     ROOT CAUSE:  THERE SEEMS TO BE HUMAN ERROR IN JUDGMENT BY MR. DUNCAN IN SEVERAL INSTANCES INVOLVING FOLLOWING PROCEDURES AND SAFETY POLICIES; THE BELOW FACTORS IN COMBINATION RELATED TO THE CAUSE OF THE FLASH FIRE WHICH RESULTED IN THE INCIDENT:  - DID NOT PURGE NATURAL GAS FROM DEACTIVATED LINE BY USING AIR OR NITROGEN GAS;  - DID NOT CHECK FOR COMPLETE PURGING (0% GAS) OF NATURAL GAS WITH A CGI (COMBUSTIBLE GAS INDICATOR) FROM THE PURGE RISER;  - DID NOT PRACTICE PREVENTING STATIC ELECTRICITY HAZARD BY USING SOAPY WATER OR ANTI-STATIC SPRAY AND BURLAP SACK ON PLASTIC PIPE AND ALSO GROUNDING TOOLS PRIOR TO CUTTING PURGE RISER FROM DEACTIVATED PIPE.  THIS ALONG WITH RESIDUAL GAS IN THE DEACTIVATED PIPE RESULTED IN A FLASH FIRE WHICH CAUSED THE INJURY.  - DID NOT WEAR PROPER PPE (PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT); FIRE RETARDANT CLOTHING AND GLOVES.  - DID NOT HAVE ANOTHER WORKER AT PURGE LOCATION ON FIRE WATCH WITH A FIRE EXTINGUISHER.     THE ABOVE INSTANCES (WHICH WERE NOT FOLLOWED) ARE COVERED IN ATMOS ENERGY'S O&M PROCEDURES AND SAFETY MANUAL; THEY ARE ALSO COVERED UNDER OQ TASKS L2 - ACTIVATING AND PURGING PIPELINES AND M8 - PREVENTING ACCIDENTAL IGNITION."

A THIRD PARTY (GM ENGINEERING) STRUCK A 2-INCH PLASTIC DISTRIBUTION MAIN (NEAR A 3-WAY TEE, WHICH BRANCHES OFF A 4-INCH PLASTIC DISTRIBUTION MAIN) WITH A BACKHOE, CAUSING AN UNINTENTIONAL RELEASE OF NATURAL GAS. THE THIRD PARTY CALLED USA (NO. 459722) ON 11/3/2014.  PG&E RECEIVED THE NORMAL NOTICE ON 11/03/2014 (11:25:55 AM).  IN RESPONSE TO THE TICKET, PG&E ATTEMPTED TO MAKE CONTACT WITH THE EXCAVATOR BEFORE LOCATING AND MARKING ITS FACILITIES.  PG&E LEFT A MESSAGE FOR THE EXCAVATOR ON 11/5/2014 BUT DID NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE FROM THE EXCAVATOR TO COORDINATE THE LOCATE AND MARK PRIOR TO THE EXCAVATION. (AS IS CUSTOMARY FOR LARGE EXCAVATION PROJECTS, PG&E COMMUNICATES WITH THE EXCAVATORS TO PHASE THE MARKING OF PG&E FACILITIES TO ENSURE MARKINGS REMAIN VISIBLE IN THE EXCAVATION AREA.) A PG&E GAS SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE (GSR) ARRIVED ON SCENE AT 1131 HOURS. PG&E REPAIR CREW ARRIVED AT APPROXIMATELY 1140 HOURS.  GAS WAS COMPLETELY SHUT IN AT 1702 HOURS BY CLOSING 10 DISTRIBUTION MAIN VALVES AND ISOLATING APPROXIMATELY 4 BLOCKS OF THE GAS DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM AND 40 CUSTOMERS. PG&E INITIALLY PLANNED TO SAFELY SQUEEZE THE 2-INCH DIAMETER PLASTIC PIPE AT A LOCATION AWAY FROM THE PERIPHERY OF THE DIG-IN LOCATION. UPON FURTHER EVALUATION IT WAS DETERMINED THAT DIGGING AND SQUEEZING THE LINE WOULD TAKE A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF TIME DUE TO THE DEPTH EXCEEDING 5 FEET AND THE NEED TO INSTALL SHORING TO COMPLETE THIS WORK. ONCE PG&E ESTIMATED THE TOTAL TIME REQUIRED FOR THE SHUT-IN, PG&E DECIDED TO LOOK FOR AN ALTERNATIVE THAT INCLUDED CLOSING VALVES IN THE SURROUNDING AREA THAT COULD POTENTIALLY CAUSE MORE CUSTOMER OUTAGES.  PG&E DETERMINED THAT CLOSING VALVES WAS THE FASTEST AND SAFEST METHOD AND CHOSE TO CLOSE NEARBY VALVES FOR SHUTTING IN GAS FLOW. REPAIR CREW REPLACED THE 4X4X2-INCH TEE AND THE DAMAGED 2-INCH DISTRIBUTION MAIN. ABOUT 2,500 PEOPLE WERE EVACUATED FROM OFFICE BUILDINGS ON A TWO-BLOCK AREA OF MARKET AND FIRST AND SAN PEDRO STREETS. SANTA CLARA STREET WAS CLOSED BETWEEN FIRST AND SAN PEDRO STREETS, ACCORDING TO THE VALLEY TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY. BUS LINES 22, 522, 68, 17, 168, AND 181 WERE REROUTED, VTA OFFICIALS SAID. SEVERAL SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA NEWS STATIONS WERE OBSERVED ON SCENE (I.E., KTVU, NBC BAY AREA).

THE CREW INSTALLED A NEW SERVICE TEE, TRANSFERRED THE SERVICE CONNECTION AND INSTALLED AN ADAM SLEEVE OVER THE LEAKING SECTION AS A 'MAKE SAFE' TEMPORARY REPAIR.  THEY MONITORED THE LOCATION OVERNIGHT.  THE FOLLOWING DAY (OCTOBER 29TH) THE CREW RETURNED TO THE LOCATION TO MAKE THE PERMANENT REPAIR.  IN ORDER TO PERFORM THE REPAIR, THEY NEEDED TO ISOLATE THE SECTION OF MAIN BY APPLYING SQUEEZE OFF DEVICES.  THEY REVIEWED THE NRG MAPS AND CONTACTED GAS CONTROL TO CONFIRM THAT THE MAIN WAS BACK FED.  THE GAS CONTROL OPERATOR UTILIZED THE 'CONNECTIVITY' TOOL IN THE NRG MAPPING SYSTEM AND PANNED TO ABOUT 600 SCALE IN ORDER TO CONFIRM BACKFEED.  SINCE THE 'CONNECTIVITY' TOOL AND A PAN OF THE AREA CONFIRMED THAT THERE WAS A BACKFEED, APPROVAL TO PERFORM THE SQUEEZE OFF WAS GRANTED BY GAS CONTROL.  UNFORTUNATELY, THE 'CONNECTIVITY' TOOL DID NOT ACCOUNT FOR THE DEAD END OF THE MAIN WHICH IS ABOUT 1.6 MILES FROM THE JOB LOCATION.  FIELD OPS NOR GAS CONTROL IDENTIFIED THE DEADEND IN THE NRG MAPPING SYSTEM WHEN THEY REVIEWED IT BECAUSE TO CAPTURE BOTH THE JOB LOCATION AND THE DEAD END, THE USER WOULD HAVE TO ZOOM OUT TO 900 SCALE. THE CREW INSTALLED AND MONITORED PRESSURE GAUGES PRIOR TO THE INSTALLATION OF THE ISOLATION DEVICES (SQUEEZE OFFS).

THE TECHNICIAN ARRIVED ON SITE, CONDUCTED A LEAK SURVEY OF THE AREA AND CONCLUDED THAT GAS WAS NOT MIGRATING AND ACCORDING TO AVAILABLE DATA DID NOT BELIEVE THE LEAK TO BE ON A DOMINION FACILITY.  THE TECHNICIAN NOTIFIED THE FIRE CHIEF OF HIS FINDINGS.  AT APPROXIMATELY 11:55 P.M. DOMINION WAS NOTIFIED BY THE EPA THAT OIL WAS BUBBLING UP FROM THE GROUND AND THAT THEY WERE PICKING UP HIGH NATURAL GAS READINGS.  ANOTHER TECHNICIAN WAS IMMEDIATELY DISPATCHED TO THE SCENE, ARRIVED AT 12:47 A.M. ON 10/2/2014, AND UPON INVESTIGATION DETERMINED THAT DEO'S 30"" DISTRIBUTION LINE WAS LEAKING AND CALLED IN FOR A CONSTRUCTION CREW.  THE TECHNICIAN CONTINUED TO LEAK SURVEY THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT.  AS ADDITIONAL DOMINION PERSONNEL ARRIVED ON SITE, THE INVESTIGATION CONTINUED AND DETERMINED THAT THE LINE WAS DEEPER THAN A DOMINION CREW COULD HANDLE, THEREFORE A CONTRACTING CREW WAS MOBILIZED.  AT APPROXIMATELY 5:00 A.M. DOMINION'S ENVIRONMENTAL CONTRACTORS ARRIVED ON SITE AND BEGAN ENVIRONMENTAL CLEANUP ACTIVITIES.  THE AREA WAS EVACUATED AT APPROXIMATELY 6:00 A.M.  AS MEASURE OF SAFETY, BEFORE EXCAVATING COULD OCCUR DOMINION DECIDED TO LOWER THE PRESSURE IN THE PIPELINE.  AT APPROXIMATELY 10:00 AM THE PRESSURE WAS LOWERED FROM 155 PSIG TO 60 PSIG.  ONCE THE PRESSURE WAS STABILIZED DOMINION BEGAN EXCAVATING.  AT APPROXIMATELY 5:00 P.M. A CLAMP WAS INSTALLED AND PRESSURE RESTORED.      THE SECTION OF PIPE THAT LEAKED WAS CUT OUT AND SENT TO KIEFNER & ASSOCIATES FOR A 3RD PARTY FAILURE ANALYSIS.  THE RESULTS OF THE TEST CONCLUDED THAT THE CAUSE OF THE LEAK WAS A THROUGH-WALL INTERNAL CORROSION PIT AT THE 6 O'CLOCK POSITION.  TEST RESULTS SUGGEST THAT MICROBIAL-INDUCED CORROSION (MIC) PLAYED A ROLE IN THE PITTING CORROSION.  DOMINION REPLACED APPROXIMATELY 800 FEET OF THE 30"" HIGH PRESSURE DISTRIBUTION LINE THAT LEAKED AND WILL REPLACE ADDITIONAL PORTIONS OF ADJACENT PIPELINES THROUGHOUT 2015."

A LOCATE WAS REQUESTED FROM THE ARKANSAS ONE CALL CENTER TO LOCATED ALL FACILITIES; HOWEVER THE CONTRACTOR WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR LOCATING THE CENTERPOINT ENERGY FACILITIES.  EMPLOYEES OF J.F CONSTRUCTION USED A PIPE LOCATOR TO VERIFY THE LOCATION OF THE EXISTING SERVICE, FOUND IT TO NOT BE IN CONFLICT WITH THEIR PLANNED WORK, BUT DID NOT COMPLETELY MARK THE REMAINDER OF THE SERVICE LINE.  DUE TO THE LARGE TREES ON THE PROPERTY, THE ORIGINAL SERVICE LINE INSTALLATION DID NOT TAKE A PERPENDICULAR PATH FROM THE MAIN.  A PNEUMATIC BORING TOOL WAS PLACED IN A BELL HOLE FOR THE PURPOSE OF INSTALLING A NEW SERVICE.  AFTER BORING FOR ABOUT 20 MINUTES, THE TOOL STRUCK WHAT WAS DETERMINED TO BE THE EXISTING SERVICE LINE. THE IMPACT FROM THE BORING TOOL BENT THE 3/4' STEEL SERVICE LINE AT THE IMPACT POINT, CAUSING A PARTIAL SEPARATION OF THE PIPE AT A THREADED COUPLING SIX FEET EAST OF THE MOBILE HOME AND ANOTHER LEAK OF UNDETERMINED NATURE UNDER THE MOBILE HOME. APPROXIMATELY 10 MINUTES AFTER THE LEAK BEGAN, A SMALL EXPLOSION TOOK PLACE AND THE RESULTING FLASH CAUSED SECOND-DEGREE BURNS TO THE RESIDENT INSIDE THE MOBILE HOME.

THE WORK INVOLVED REPLACING A WEIGHTED LEVER REGULATOR WITH A WORKER/MONITOR REGULATOR SET STYLE OF STATION.    THE EXISTING REGULATOR WAS REMOVED AND NEW REGULATORS WERE INSTALLED.  ONCE INSTALLED, LEAKAGE WAS DISCOVERED ON THE NEW REGULATOR STATION PRE-ASSEMBLED PIPING.  THE NEW STATION REGULATORS WERE REMOVED TO MAKE REPAIRS.    WHILE REPAIRS WERE BEING MADE TO THE WORKER/MONITOR SET, IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT A FITTING USED FOR ONE OF THE CONTROL LINES WAS LEAKING.  A WELDER WAS REQUESTED AND DISPATCHED TO THE WORK SITE TO REPAIR THE LEAKING FITTING.    BLIND FLANGES WERE INSTALLED WHERE THE NEW WORKER/MONITOR SET HAD BEEN REMOVED AND TWO EMPLOYEES BEGAN MAKING A REPAIR TO THE LEAKING FITTING.  A WELD CONE WAS INSTALLED INTO THE LEAKING THREADED FITTING TO STOP THE LEAK PRIOR TO FINALIZING THE REPAIR.  DURING THE CONTAINMENT OF THE LEAKAGE, AS ADDITIONAL WORK WAS BEING CONDUCTED, A SMALL FLASH FIRE OCCURRED, CAUSING SUPERFICIAL BURNS TO ONE OF THE EMPLOYEES COMPLETING THE WORK IN THE VAULT.  THE INJURED EMPLOYEE WAS HOSPITALIZED OVERNIGHT TO HAVE HIS INJURIES EXAMINED AND TO CONFIRM THAT THE BURNS WERE EXTERNAL AND MINOR IN NATURE.

SINCE WHOLE DOLLARS ARE REQUIRED, THE COST OF GAS LOST WAS $1.00.    PAGE 3, PART E, LINES 1-3.  THIS WAS A DISTRIBUTION LINE OPERATING AT 12 OUNCES.  BECAUSE THE PRESSURE MUST BE SHOWN AS PSIG, THE PRESSURE WOULD EQUATE TO .75 PSIG.  NO CHANGES WERE MADE TO THESE LINES.    PAGE 4, PART G1.

THE EMPLOYEE HAD BEEN DISPATCHED TO 4777 WELLINGTON DRIVE TO COMPLETE A LEAK INVESTIGATION ORDER THAT WAS CREATED AT 2152 HOURS. DURING THE LEAK INVESTIGATION, THE EMPLOYEE SMELLED AN ODOR AT THE CORNER OF WELLINGTON DRIVE AND TRENTON COURT AND DETECTED 0.3% LEL WITH A COMBUSTIBLE GAS INDICATOR (CGI).    THE EMPLOYEE NOTICED FERTILIZER AND MULCH IN THE AREA. IN ACCORDANCE WITH PROCEDURES AND TRAINING, THE EMPLOYEE ATTACHED A CHARCOAL FILTER TO THE CGI AND DETECTED 0.0% LEL WITH THE FILTER INSTALLED. THE EMPLOYEE WALKED TOWARDS 4773 TRENTON COURT WHEN THE RESIDENT OF THE AREA FLAGGED THE EMPLOYEE DOWN AND SHOUTED THAT THERE IS A FIRE IN THE RESIDENCE NEXT DOOR. THE EMPLOYEE STARTED TO DIAL 911 AND 4771 TRENTON COURT EXPLODED AT APPROXIMATELY 2243 HOURS.    NORTH SHORE GAS STOPPED THE FLOW OF GAS BY CLOSING A SINGLE VALVE AT 0032 HOURS ON 4/26/14 AT THE DIRECTION OF THE LONG GROVE FIRE DEPARTMENT. TWO PEOPLE RECEIVED MEDICAL ATTENTION ONSITE AND WERE RELEASED. OTHER HOMES IN THE AREA WERE DAMAGED DUE TO THE EXPLOSION AND THE EXTENT IS STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION.    THE GAS MAIN THAT FED 4771 TRENTON COURT IS A 2"" BLACK PLASTIC DIRECT BURIED MAIN THAT WAS INSTALLED IN 1991. THE GAS SERVICE FOR 4771 TRENTON COURT IS A 1.125"" BLACK PLASTIC SERVICE THAT WAS INSTALLED IN 1996. THE SERVICE DID NOT HAVE AN EXCESS FLOW VALVE AS IT WAS NOT REQUIRED BY CODE AT THE TIME OF INSTALLATION. FOLLOWING THE EVENT, THE GAS MAIN AND ALL ASSOCIATED GAS SERVICE PIPES WERE PRESSURE TESTED ON 5/12/14.  THE MAINS AND SERVICES WERE PRESSURE TESTED AT 44 PSIG, THE PRESSURE IN THE LINES AT THE TIME OF THE EXPLOSION FOR 1 HOUR.  ALL MAINS AND SERVICES HELD PRESSURE DEMONSTRATING NO LEAKAGE OUT OF THESE LINES. REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ILLINOIS COMMERCE COMMISSION (ICC) PIPELINE SAFETY BRANCH WITNESSED THIS TESTING. THE 4"" BLACK PLASTIC DIRECT BURIED MAIN IN WELLINGTON DRIVE WAS RESTARTED AT APPROXIMATELY 1000 HOURS ON 4/27/14.    THE RISER FOR 4771 TRENTON COURT WAS REMOVED FROM THE SITE ON 5/15/14 FOR AN X-RAY AND IS SCHEDULED TO BE PERFORMED ON 5/23/14. THE METER AND REGULATOR ARE NOT IN A CONDITION THAT CAN BE TESTED.    6/4/14: AN X-RAY TEST WAS PERFORMED ON THE RISER PIPE ON 5/23/14 TO TEST THE MECHANICAL ASSEMBLY.     12/31/14: THE BORESCOPE PERFORMED ON 10/10/14 WAS INCONCLUSIVE. ON 11/3/14 THE RISER ASSEMBLY WAS PRESSURE TESTED AND DID NOT HOLD PRESSURE DUE TO EXTENSIVE DAMAGE TO THE PLASTIC PIPE INSIDE THE RISER. THE HOME APPLIANCES ARE STILL IN THE PROCESS OF BEING TESTED.    9/14/15: A RE-ASSEMBLY OF THE GAS SYSTEM INSIDE OF THE HOUSE IS BEING GENERATED. PGL IS PLANNING AN ADDITIONAL TEST ON THE RISER.    12/15/15: THE RE-ASSEMBLY AND TESTING OF THE GAS SYSTEM INSIDE OF THE HOUSE WAS COMPLETED.    6/27/17: FURTHER EXAMINATION OF THE RISER DETERMINED A STIFFENER HAD NOT BEEN INSTALLED IN THE SERVICE, AS WAS THE PRACTICE AT THE TIME THE SERVICE WAS INSTALLED. HOWEVER, THERE IS NO INDICATION THAT THE RISER WAS LEAKING OR THAT THERE WAS A PATH FOR THE GAS TO TRAVEL FROM THE OUTSIDE OF THE HOUSE INTO THE HOUSE IF GAS HAD BEEN PRESENT. THEREFORE, NSG HAS DETERMINED THAT JURISDICTIONAL GAS PLAYED NO ROLE IN THE CAUSE OF THIS INCIDENT. THE EVENT WAS CAUSED BY CUSTOMER OWNED PIPING AND/OR EQUIPMENT INSIDE THE HOUSE.

UPON ARRIVAL, THE FAIRFAX COUNTY FIRE DEPARTMENT WAS ON SITE AND CONTROLLING THE SCENE.  NATURAL GAS APPEARED TO BE RELEASING IN THE GENERAL AREA OF THE GAS METER.  THE GAS WAS CONTROLLED BY SQUEEZE-OFF OF THE PLASTIC SERVICE LINE AT 11:08 AM.  WASHINGTON GAS PERSONNEL CONDUCTED BAR/TEST IN THE AREA OF THE INCIDENT AND OBSERVED NO EVIDENCE OF GAS MIGRATION.  AN ODORANT SAMPLE WAS TAKEN AND THE LEVEL OF ODORANT WAS DETERMINED TO BE ACCEPTABLE.  A PRESSURE TEST WAS CONDUCTED ON THE PLASTIC SERVICE LINE FROM THE SQUEEZE-OFF POINT TO THE UPPER END OF THE STEEL SERVICE RISER.  THE PRESSURE TEST WAS CONDUCTED AT OPERATING PRESSURE FOR 15 MINUTES.  THE SERVICE HELD THE PRESSURE TEST.  A FRACTURE WAS OBSERVED AT THE THREADED END OF THE RISER IMMEDIATELY BELOW THE STOPCOCK.  FOLLOW-UP ANALYSIS OF THE THREADED END OF THE RISER INDICATED THAT THE FRACTURE OF THE STEEL PIPE WAS CAUSED BY THE APPLICATION OF A SINGLE HIGH LOAD EXCEEDING THE FRACTURE STRENGTH OF THE STEEL. THERE WAS NO INDICATION THAT ENVIRONMENT OR FATIGUE LOADING CONTRIBUTED TO THIS FAILURE.  UPON GAINING ACCESS TO THE MOBILE HOME ON 5/5/2014, WASHINGTON GAS CONDUCTED A PRESSURE TEST ON THE REMAINING HOUSE LINES UNDER THE OBSERVATION OF THE FAIRFAX COUNTY FIRE MARSHAL.  THE HOUSE LINE TO THE STOVE WAS FRACTURED AND THE STOVE WAS FOUND ON THE GROUND BENEATH THE FLOOR LEVEL OF THE MOBILE HOME.  THIS LINE WAS CAPPED TO PERFORM THE PRESSURE TEST.  THE TEST WAS CONDUCTED AT 10 INCHES OF WATER COLUMN FOR 13 MINUTES.  THE HOUSE LINES HELD THE PRESSURE TEST.  THE FRACTURED LINE TO THE STOVE WAS REMOVED FOR ANALYSIS.  AT THIS TIME, THE INVESTIGATION OF THIS INCIDENT IS ONGOING.  THE FAIRFAX COUNTY FIRE MARSHAL REPORT HAS NOT BEEN COMPLETED AND THE CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT IS UNDETERMINED.

AT 09:34, GERC CONFIRMED WITH NEW YORK CITY FIRE DEPARTMENT (FDNY) A SCANNER REPORT OF AN EXPLOSION AND BUILDING COLLAPSE AT E. 114TH ST. AND PARK AVENUE (THE E. 114TH ST. LOCATION WAS INCORRECT).  AT 09:38, THE GDS MECHANIC ENROUTE TO 1652 PARK AVENUE REPORTED OBSERVING SMOKE, FLAMES, AND HEAVY ACTIVITY ON PARK AVENUE SOUTH OF E. 119TH STREET.  GERC DISPATCHED ADDITIONAL CON EDISON PERSONNEL TO THE LOCATION AT APPROXIMATELY 09:38.  CON EDISON PERSONNEL FIRST ARRIVED AT THE LOCATION AT 09:40 AND CONFIRMED THE EXPLOSION AND COLLAPSE OF TWO BUILDINGS ON PARK AVENUE BETWEEN E. 116TH ST. AND E. 117TH ST.    NUMEROUS CON EDISON PERSONNEL, INCLUDING GDS MECHANICS, CONSTRUCTION CREWS, SUPERVISORS, PLANNERS, AND MANAGERS RESPONDED TO THE SCENE OF THE BUILDING COLLAPSE.  CON EDISON PERSONNEL CONDUCTED AN INVESTIGATION FOR GAS MIGRATION THAT INCLUDED ADJACENT BUILDINGS AND ACCESSIBLE SUBSURFACE STRUCTURES IN THE AREA.  CON EDISON PERSONNEL IDENTIFIED THREE (3) FIRE BANK LOCATIONS FOR EXCAVATION TO STOP THE FLOW OF GAS ON THE WEST SIDE OF PARK AVENUE BETWEEN E 116TH ST AND E 117TH ST.  AT APPROXIMATELY 13:44, A STREET COLLAPSE AND AN APPARENT WATER MAIN BREAK WERE OBSERVED IN THE ROADWAY IN FRONT OF 1644 AND 1646 PARK AVENUE.  AT THE TIME OF THE STREET COLLAPSE, THERE WAS A STRONG ODOR OF GAS IN THE AREA.    FIRE BANK EXCAVATIONS WERE COMPLETED AND STOPPERS WERE INSTALLED TO ISOLATE THE GAS SUPPLY TO THE AFFECTED AREA AT APPROXIMATELY 13:44, AND THE ODOR OF GAS DISSIPATED.  THE 8"" LOW PRESSURE POLYETHYLENE / 8"" LOW PRESSURE CAST IRON MAIN SUPPLYING (7) SERVICES ON THE WEST SIDE OF PARK AVENUE AND ON THE NORTH SIDE OF E. 116TH ST., BETWEEN PARK AVENUE AND MADISON AVENUE, WERE ISOLATED.    INVESTIGATION:    FOLLOWING THE ACCIDENT, THE NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD (NTSB) TOOK CONTROL OF THE INCIDENT SITE AND BEGAN ITS INVESTIGATION. THE CITY OF NEW YORK, THE NEW YORK STATE PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION, THE PIPELINE AND HAZARDOUS MATERIALS SAFETY ADMINISTRATION, CONSOLIDATED EDISON COMPANY OF NEW YORK, AND GEORG FISCHER CENTRAL PLASTIC WERE PARTIES TO THE INVESTIGATION. DURING THE COURSE OF THE NTSB INVESTIGATION, CON EDISON PROVIDED A PARTY SUBMISSION DESCRIBING THE PROBABLE CAUSE OF THE ACCIDENT AS A BREACH IN THE SEWER SYSTEM WHICH CAUSED SOIL EROSION AFFECTING SUBSURFACE UTILITIES, INCLUDING A CAST IRON WATER MAIN AND HDPE GAS FACILITIES, AND LIKELY RESULTED IN AN IMPACT BY FALLING ROADWAY PAVEMENT WHICH CRACKED THE SERVICE TEE TO 1642 PARK AVENUE. IN ITS ACCIDENT REPORT ADOPTED ON JUNE 9, 2015, THE NTSB DETERMINED THAT THE PROBABLE CAUSE OF THE ACCIDENT WAS (1) THE FAILURE OF THE DEFECTIVE FUSION JOINT AT THE SERVICE TEE, INSTALLED BY CONSOLIDATED EDISON COMPANY OF NEW YORK, INC., IN 2011, THAT ALLOWED NATURAL GAS TO LEAK FROM THE GAS MAIN AND MIGRATE INTO THE BUILDING WHERE IT IGNITED AND (2) A BREACH IN THE SEWER LINE THAT WENT UNREPAIRED BY THE NEW YORK CITY DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION SINCE AT LEAST 2006 THAT ALLOWED GROUNDWATER AND SOIL TO FLOW INTO THE SEWER, RESULTING IN A LOSS OF SUPPORT FOR THE GAS MAIN, WHICH CAUSED THE LINE TO SAG AND OVERSTRESSED THE DEFECTIVE FUSION JOINT."

PG&E HAS DETERMINED THAT GAS MOST LIKELY ESCAPED FROM THE 11/4-INCH DIAMETER PLASTIC MAIN AND MIGRATED INTO A SEPARATED SEWER LATERAL THAT PROVIDED A PATH INTO THE HOUSE.  NO ONE WAS IN THE HOUSE AT THE TIME OF THE EXPLOSION.  A PG&E GAS SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE WAS ON SITE AT 1135 HOURS.  PG&E REPAIR CREWS WERE ON SITE AT 1138 HOURS.

DEBRIS FROM THE EXPLOSION FELL ONTO THE ROOF OF A NEIGHBORING HOUSE, AND GAS SERVICE TO THAT HOUSE WAS SHUT OFF AS A PRECAUTION.  THE FLOW OF GAS WAS STOPPED AT 1145 HOURS BY SQUEEZING THE MAIN AT TWO LOCATIONS.  THE REPAIR CREW ALSO DUG UP AND SQUEEZED THE SERVICE LINE TO THE DAMAGED HOUSE.  THE GAS MAIN WAS THEN CAPPED AT 1209 HOURS.  THIS INCIDENT WAS REPORTED TO THE DOT AND THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION DUE TO PROPERTY DAMAGES EXCEEDING $50,000.  PG&E CONDUCTED A SPECIAL LEAK SURVEY AFTER THE INCIDENT, AND ONE LEAK ON A SERVICE VALVE IN THE VICINITY WAS FOUND AND REPAIRED.

PIN BAR TESTING WAS PERFORMED AT THE NORTH SIDE OF THE HOUSE NEAR THE METER, WHERE 15% GAS READS WERE FOUND.  ADDITIONAL BAR TESTING REVEALED SUSTAINED 95% GAS READS AT THE SOUTHWEST CORNER OF THE HOUSE AND 100% GAS READS APPROXIMATELY 45 FEET WEST OF THE HOUSE NEAR THE ROAD.  A STRONG GAS ODOR WAS EVIDENT IN THIS LOCATION.  FIRST RESPONDERS THEN TOOK GAS READINGS INSIDE THE BASEMENT AFTER BEING ESCORTED IN BY THE FIRE MARSHALL.    BAR TESTING AT ADJACENT HOUSES (SOUTH AND WEST OF 2754 WILDER) PRODUCED NO GAS READS.    AT 1:42 AM ON MARCH 1, A GAS DISTRIBUTION CREW ARRIVED AND EXPOSED THE 2 INCH STEEL MAIN IN FRONT OF (WEST OF) 2754 WILDER.  THE MAIN WAS BENT, CRACKED AND LEAKING.  THE CREW OPENED UP THE HOLE TO VENT THE BLOWING GAS.  A FROST BALL ON THE LEAK WAS KNOCKED OFF AT 5:45 AM, AT WHICH POINT THE GAS BEGAN BLOWING.  AT 9:20 AM, A 2"" PLIDCO REPAIR SLEEVE, WHICH STOPPED THE LEAK AND REPAIRED THE MAIN. INVESTIGATION CONCLUDED THE APPARENT CAUSE OF THE MAIN LEAK WAS DAMAGE DURING INSTALLATION OF A WATER MAIN; THE EXACT TIME PERIOD OF THE WATER MAIN INSTALLATION IS UNKNOWN. THIS CONCLUSION IS BASED ON THE OBSERVED DAMAGE AND PROXIMITY OF THE WATER MAIN. THE LOCATION OF THE MAIN LEAK WAS APPROXIMATELY 45 FEET FROM THE SOUTHWEST CORNER OF THE HOUSE. A SEARCH OF MISS DIG STAKING REQUESTS FOR THIS LOCATION DID NOT YIELD ANY RECENT STAKING TICKETS WITHIN THE LAST 15 MONTHS.    THE ORIGIN OF THE HOUSEFIRE WAS APPARENTLY THE BASEMENT OF THE HOME.  ALTHOUGH AN ON-SCENE INVESTIGATOR REPRESENTING THE HOMEOWNER'S INSURANCE COMPANY (STATE FARM) INDICATED THAT THE GAS LEAK MAY HAVE CAUSED THE FIRE, FOLLOW-UP INVESTIGATION BY CONSUMERS ENERGY INDICATES THAT THIS SCENARIO IS UNLIKELY.  THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF AN EXPLOSION OR INDEED IGNITION OF GAS IN THE HOME, AND WHILE THERE WERE EXTREMELY LOW LEVELS OF GAS DETECTED IN THE BASEMENT BY FIRST RESPONDERS (0.16% GAS READS, OR 4% LEL), THIS SEEMS TO HAVE OCCURRED AS A RESULT OF ALL DOORS AND WINDOWS (INCLUDING THOSE IN THE BASEMENT) BEING OPENED BY THE FIRE DEPARTMENT, ALLOWING GAS TO ENTER THE HOME FROM OUTSIDE.  THERE WERE NO APPARENT CRACKS OR HOLES IN THE BASEMENT WALL WHICH WOULD OTHERWISE PROVIDE A PATH OF MIGRATION INTO THE HOME, AND NO LEAKS WERE FOUND ON THE METER OR THE STEEL GAS SERVICE TO THE HOME.  FURTHERMORE, THE MAJORITY OF FIRE DAMAGE WAS SOME DISTANCE FROM THE NORTHWEST SIDE OF THE BASEMENT (THE SIDE CLOSEST TO THE GAS FACILITIES)    THE FIRE DEPARTMENT CHIEF ON SITE WAS ULTIMATELY UNABLE TO COME TO A DETERMINATION ON THE CAUSE OF THE HOUSEFIRE.  DUE TO THE LACK OF CERTAINTY ABOUT THE SOURCE OF FIRE, AS WELL AS PROPERTY DAMAGE WITHIN THE HOME (DAMAGES TO APPLIANCES AND SMOKE DAMAGE) LIKELY EXCEEDING $50,000, THIS INCIDENT WAS REPORTED TO THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER. DAMAGE ESTIMATES FROM THE FIRE OBTAINED FROM VARIOUS INVESTIGATORS RANGE FROM APPROXIMATELY $50,000 TO $110,000; INSURANCE COMPANY REPRESENTATIVES STATED THAT THE HOME WAS INSURED TO A VALUE OF $160,000.     INVESTIGATION INTO THE CAUSE OF THE FIRE WERE INCONCLUSIVE AND REPORTED AS SUCH ON THE 30-DAY PHMSA REPORT ORIGINALLY SUBMITTED ON MARCH 27, 2014.  SUBSEQUENT SPECULATION BY AN INSURANCE COMPANY INVESTIGATOR (WITHOUT PERFORMING ANY INVESTIGATION) WAS THAT THE CAUSE OF THE FIRE WAS NATURAL GAS MIGRATION FROM AN EXTERNAL NATURAL GAS LEAK (CAUSED BY THE INSTALLATION OF A WATER MAIN).  THE SPECULATION OF THE INSURANCE COMPANY INVESTIGATOR WAS INCORPORATED INTO THE WATERFORD REGIONAL FIRE DEPARTMENT'S REPORT.  DUE TO THE COMPLETE DESTRUCTION OF THE SCENE BY THE FIRE DEPARTMENT, NO ACTUAL INVESTIGATION WAS POSSIBLE AND NO LEGITIMATE CONCLUSIONS CAN BE REACHED."

AN INITIAL REPORT FROM THE ATTICA VOLUNTEER FIRE DEPARTMENT INDICATES THE ITEM FIRST IGNITED WAS GAS VAPOR IN AIR AND THAT FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO IGNITION WERE RUPTURED GAS LINE ALLOWED GAS TO MIGRATE ALONG WATER LINES INTO BASEMENT OF BUILDING.      VECTREN IS CONTINUING ITS OWN INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION INTO THE CAUSE AND ORIGIN OF THIS INCIDENT.    UPDATE: VECTREN'S INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION INTO THE CAUSE AND ORIGIN OF THIS INCIDENT INCLUDED A ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS AND A METALLURGICAL DESTRUCTIVE TESTING OF THE 4"" STEEL MAIN REFERENCED IN THE FIRST PARAGRAPH OF THIS NARRATIVE.  THE ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS, WHILE BENEFICIAL IN IDENTIFYING POTENTIAL FACTORS THAT MAY HAVE PLAYED A ROLE IN THE INCIDENT, WAS INCONCLUSIVE AS TO THE ORIGIN OR CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT.  ADDITIONALLY, THE METALLURGICAL DESTRUCTIVE TESTING OF THE 4"" STEEL MAIN AND ASSOCIATED CRACKED OXY-ACETYLENE WELDED MITER JOINT PROVIDED NO DEFINITIVE CONCLUSION AS TO WHETHER THE CRACKED WELD WAS A RESULT OF THE EXPLOSION, OR A CONDITION EXISTING AT THE TIME OF THE EXPLOSION."

A SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT WILL BE SUBMITTED UPON COMPLETION OF THE INVESTIGATION BY SWG.    NOTE: FOR PART A, #10, THE ESTIMATED VOLUME OF GAS RELEASED THAT IS IDENTIFIED REPRESENTS AN ESTIMATE THAT PRESUMES A CRACK THAT IS LEAKING AT 57 PSI, BEGINNING AT THE TIME OF THE INTIAL REPORT OF THE INCIDENT AND ENDING AT THE TIME THE PIPELINE WAS SHUT DOWN.  HOWEVER, THE ACTUAL AMOUNT OF GAS LOSS IS UNKNOWN BECAUSE THE TIME THE GAS PIPELINE BEGAN LEAKING IS UNKNOWN.    SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT:  LABORATORY ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT THE LEAKS WERE PRESENT DUE TO THERMAL OXIDATION OF THE PIPES AT 1914 AND 1924 E. PALOMINO.  THE THERMAL OXIDATION OF THE PIPES RESULTED IN AXIAL SLIT-CRACKS ON THE PIPES AT BOTH LOCATIONS.  SECTION G5 IS REVISED TO REFLECT THIS FACT."

BANCROFT STREET.  AN FSD TECHNICIAN WAS DISPATCHED TO INVESTIGATE THIS LEAK.  HE ARRIVED ON LOCATION AT 17:29 AND BEGAN HIS INVESTIGATION.  A READING OF 70% LEL AT THE FRONT FOUNDATION WALL TO 1845 S. BANCROFT WAS REPORTED BY THE TECHNICIAN TO THE FSD DISPATCHER.  BASED ON THIS REPORT, A DISTRIBUTION CREW WAS DISPATCHED AT 18:10.  FSD AND DISTRIBUTION SUPERVISION WERE ALSO DISPATCHED TO THE LOCATION.  THE CREW ARRIVED ON LOCATION AT 18:24 AND IMMEDIATELY BEGAN THEIR INVESTIGATION.  DURING THE COURSE OF THE INVESTIGATION AND WHILE THE DISTRIBUTION FOREMAN AND THE FSD TECHNICIAN WERE INSIDE THE PROPERTY AT 1849 S. BANCROFT CHECKING FOR GAS READINGS, AN EXPLOSION TOOK PLACE AT APPROXIMATELY 19:05 INSIDE 1849 S. BANCROFT.  THE EXPLOSION SEVERELY DAMAGED THE TWO RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS AT 1849 AND 1847 S. BANCROFT.  IT ALSO INJURED BOTH PGW EMPLOYEES WHO WERE INSIDE THE HOUSE, AS WELL AS ONE HOMEOWNER.  THE INJURIES SUSTAINED BY ALL THREE INDIVIDUALS WERE NON-LIFE THREATENING.  BOTH THE DISTRIBUTION FOREMAN AND HOMEOWNER WERE TAKEN TO A LOCAL HOSPITAL FOR TREATMENT AND RELEASED ON THE SAME DAY WHILE THE FSD TECHNICIAN WAS ADMITTED WITH BURNS TO HIS NECK AND LOWER TORSO.  THE EXPLOSION AT THE SCENE WAS OBSERVED BY A FSD SUPERVISOR WHO HAD JUST ARRIVED ON THE SCENE AT 19:05.  PHILADELPHIA FIRE DEPARTMENT, PHILADELPHIA POLICE DEPARTMENT AND PECO ENERGY WERE CALLED IN FOR ASSISTANCE, IN ADDITION TO VARIOUS PGW RESOURCES SUCH AS, DISTRIBUTION CREWS, FSD TECHNICIANS, MOBILE EQUIPMENT, GREASE TRUCK, SUPERVISORY PERSONNEL, CHEMICAL SERVICES, ETC.  THE PAPUC WAS ALSO NOTIFIED OF THE INCIDENT.    A DEAD END GAS MAIN THAT WAS INSTALLED IN THE EAST FOOTWAY IN FRONT OF 1849 S. BANCROFT (4"" 1939 LOW PRESSURE CAST IRON MAIN) WAS GREASED OFF THROUGH A PLASTIC SERVICE TO 1843 S. BANCROFT AT 19:51 AND THE LEAK CONSEQUENTLY WAS MADE SAFE.  AS A RESULT OF THE GREASING OFF, A TOTAL OF FOUR (4) PROPERTIES WERE TEMPORARILY OUT OF GAS.  PECO ALSO SHUT OFF THE ELECTRIC POWER TO 1849 S. BANCROFT AT 21:00.  AFTER MAKING THE JOB SAFE AND RECEIVING THE GO AHEAD FROM PFD, PGW PERSONNEL ON THE SCENE CONTINUED WITH THE INVESTIGATION.  EVERY BUILDING ON THE 1800 BLOCK OF S. BANCROFT WAS CHECKED FOR GAS READINGS.  ALSO, THE 4"" CAST IRON MAIN ON THE BLOCK ALONG WITH ALL ACTIVE GAS SERVICES WERE BAR HOLED IN ORDER TO CHECK FOR ANY POSSIBLE LEAKS.  DURING THIS BLOCK CHECK THE CREW PICKED UP LEL READINGS IN FRONT OF 1835 AND 1816/1818.  A BROKEN MAIN WAS EVENTUALLY FOUND AND REPAIRED IN FRONT OF 1818 AND A TOTAL OF SIX (6) SERVICES ON THE BLOCK WERE RENEWED WITH PLASTIC.  THE GREASED 4"" MAIN WAS ALSO CUT AND CAPPED AT 03:45.  THIS PORTION OF THE 4"" MAIN THAT WAS CUT AND CAPPED (100') WAS AIR TESTED AT 6"" WC AND THE TEST FAILED.  THIS SECTION OF THE MAIN WAS THEN EXCAVATED COMPLETELY AND A BROKEN MAIN WAS FOUND IN FRONT OF 1849.  AN 8' SECTION OF THE PIPE, CONTAINING THE BROKEN MAIN, WAS CUT AND REMOVED FROM THE EXCAVATION, TAGGED AS EVIDENCE AND TRANSPORTED TO THE PGW EVIDENCE ROOM ON 1/31/2014.  THE SERVICES TO 1845 AND 1847 (BOTH 1 1/4"" UNPROTECTED STEEL SERVICES) WERE ALSO AIR TESTED AND FAILED.  AFTER THE INVESTIGATION WAS COMPLETED, THE GAS SERVICE WAS RESTORED TO THE PROPERTIES THAT WERE SHUT OFF DURING THE GREASE OFF PROCESS.  THE BUILDING AT 1849 THAT WAS DAMAGED BY THE EXPLOSION WAS DEMOLISHED BY THE CITY OF PHILADELPHIA ON 2/1/2014.  FINALLY, THE 4"" CAST IRON MAIN ON THE BLOCK WAS SUBSEQUENTLY REPLACED WITH PLASTIC BY PGW OVER THE FOLLOWING TWO WEEKS."

THE CALLER STATED THE FIRE WAS CONTAINED AND THAT THERE WAS ALSO GAS BURNING. WE ENERGIES IMMEDIATELY DISPATCHED A FIRST RESPONDER TO THE SITE.  THE FIRST RESPONDER ARRIVED ON SITE AT 11:47 A.M. AND OBSERVED A STRUCTURE FIRE; BUT THERE WERE NO SIGNS OF AN EXPLOSION. THE EMPLOYEE NOTED THAT THE STRUCTURE FIRE WAS ESSENTIALLY UNDER CONTROL BUT NATURAL GAS WAS BURNING AT THE OUTSIDE METER AND AT A FEW LOCATIONS ON THE GROUND NEAR THE BUILDING. THE FIRST RESPONDER SAW THAT MORE RESOURCES WERE NEEDED TO REMOTELY SHUT OFF THE GAS AND MADE THE REQUEST TO THE DISPATCHER. THE FIRST RESPONDER AND ANOTHER EMPLOYEE WHO HAD ARRIVED PROCEEDED TO CHECK FOR GAS MIGRATION AND WORK WITH FIRE DEPARTMENT PERSONNEL TO KEEP A SAFE PERIMETER. INITIAL PROBING AND RECHECKS VERIFIED THAT GAS WAS ONLY IN THE AREA OF THE STRUCTURE FIRE.  AT ABOUT 12:52 P.M., MORE PERSONNEL ARRIVED AND BEGAN DIGGING TO REMOTELY SQUEEZE OFF GAS ON THIS ONE-WAY FEED TO 2800 LAKESHORE WAY AND THE PROPERTY TO THE NORTH. A FROST DEPTH OF ABOUT 3 FT. MADE EXCAVATION HARD, AND THE 1958-INSTALLED 1 1/4 IN. STEEL GAS MAIN TO THE PROPERTIES WAS SQUEEZED OFF AT ABOUT 3:09 P.M. ALL FIRE AT THE PROPERTY WAS EXTINGUISHED SHORTLY THEREAFTER.  TO CONFIRM THE UNOCCUPIED HOME TO THE NORTH WAS SAFE, ACCESS WAS GAINED WITH POLICE ASSISTANCE AT ABOUT 1:30 P.M. AND ALL THREE LEVELS CHECKED AT 0%.  DUE TO THE EXTENT OF DAMAGE POTENTIALLY CAUSED BY GAS LEAKAGE FROM OPERATOR FACILITIES, A PHONE NOTIFICATION WAS MADE TO THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER AT ABOUT 4:00 P.M. TO REPORT THIS EVENT AS A POSSIBLE INCIDENT PER 49 CFR PART 191.3. THE WISCONSIN PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION (WPSC) WAS ALSO NOTIFIED.  A LINE STOPPER WAS INSTALLED AND SERVICE WAS RESTORED TO THE NEIGHBORING PROPERTY BY ABOUT 6:30 P.M. ON 1/30/14. AFTER VERIFYING THAT THE SITE WAS SAFE, THE DECISION WAS MADE TO WAIT UNTIL THE FOLLOWING DAY TO CONDUCT FURTHER INVESTIGATIONS.  ON 1/31/14, TWIN LAKES FIRE, WPSC AND COMPANY PERSONNEL MET ON SITE FOR INVESTIGATIONS. INITIAL PRESSURE TESTING OF THE ABANDONED MAIN AND SERVICE INDICATED AN UNDERGROUND LEAK, AND IT WAS BELIEVED NECESSARY TO EXCAVATE AT THE SERVICE TEE. SINCE THE PROPERTY OWNERS WERE NOT AVAILABLE TO ASSIST WITH MOVING NECESSARY PERSONAL PROPERTY, FURTHER EXCAVATION WAS DELAYED UNTIL FEBRUARY 4TH.  ON 2/4/14, TWIN LAKES FIRE, WPSC AND COMPANY PERSONNEL MET ON SITE TO CONTINUE THE INVESTIGATION. UPON EXCAVATION AT THE SERVICE TEE LOCATION FOR 2800 LAKESHORE WAY, A BENT SECTION OF MAIN WAS IDENTIFIED. THE MAIN WAS BENT IN AN ARC, AND WAS DISPLACED VERTICALLY BY ABOUT 3 IN. OVER A 6 FT. LENGTH. THE BOTTOM OF THE PIPE WAS FLATTENED AND A CRACK WAS FOUND IN THE BENT SECTION OF THE PIPE. IT IS PRESUMED THAT THE DAMAGE OCCURRED DURING A PRIOR EXCAVATION AND THAT MOVEMENT CAUSED BY THE DEEP FROST LEVELS OBSERVED THIS WINTER CONTRIBUTED TO THE FAILURE OF THE PIPE. ONE-CALL CENTER RECORDS DO NOT INDICATE ANY RECENT LOCATE TICKET REQUESTS AND IT IS THOUGHT THAT THE EXCAVATION ACTIVITY THAT DAMAGED THE PIPE OCCURRED MANY YEARS AGO.  A NEW PE MAIN WAS INSTALLED ON LAKESHORE WAY AND GAS SERVICE TO THE AFFECTED PROPERTY WAS RESTORED ON 2/14/14.  A FORMAL INCIDENT REVIEW WAS CONDUCTED ON 2/21/14. PARTICIPANTS IN THE REVIEW INCLUDED GAS DISTRIBUTION WORKERS AT THE SCENE AFTER THE FIRE WAS REPORTED AND OTHER COMPANY PERSONNEL WHO ASSISTED AT THE SCENE. PIPELINE SAFETY ENGINEERS FROM THE WPSC, ONE OF WHOM HAD INSPECTED THE SITE THE DAY AFTER THE FIRE, ALSO ATTENDED. THE REVIEW RECOUNTED THE ACTIONS TAKEN BY EACH PARTICIPANT AND INCLUDED COMMUNICATIONS CONDUCTED AMONG INVOLVED PERSONNEL.  WE ENERGIES IS PERFORMING MORE LEAK SURVEYS BEYOND THOSE REQUIRED IN CFR 49, PART 192 ON SIMILAR TYPE FACILITIES BECAUSE OF THE EXTREME WINTER CONDITIONS IN OUR SERVICE TERRITOR"

IN SHREWSBURY WHILE PERFORMING A MAIN CUT OUT. THE CREW WAS CUTTING OUT A SECTION OF 4 INCH IP PLASTIC MAIN THAT WAS LEAKING. THE CREW HAD INSTALLED A 2 INCH PLASTIC BYPASS AROUND THE LEAK AND HAD SQUEEZED OFF THE 4 INCH MAIN TO STOP OFF THE GAS. WHILE PREPARING FOR THE MAIN CUT OUT OF 4 INCH PLASTIC, A SUDDEN RUSH OF GAS OCCURRED AND THEN THE GAS IGNITED CAUSING A FIRE TO OCCUR IN THE EXCAVATION. THERE WERE 2 EMPLOYEES IN THE EXCAVATION WHO WERE ABLE TO GET THEMSELVES OUT OF THE HOLE JUST BEFORE THE IGNITION OCCURRED. ONE OF THESE EMPLOYEES DID RECEIVE SOME BURNS AND WAS TREATED AND RELEASED FROM A HOSPITAL. THE RESULTING FIRE ALSO SPREAD TO AN NSTAR BACKHOE PARKED AT THE EXCAVATION. THE SHREWSBURY FIRE DEPARTMENT WAS CALLED TO CONTROL THE GAS FIRE. AT 1:50 PM A MAIN VALVE ON COLONIAL DR. WAS SHUT TO STOP THE LEAKING GAS AND PUT OUT THE FIRE. THIS RESULTED IN AN OUTAGE TO 135 CUSTOMERS. NSTAR HAD TO REPLACE ABOUT 20 FEET OF 4 INCH PLASTIC MAIN DUE TO FIRE DAMAGE. AFTER THE SHUTDOWN PROCEDURE WAS COMPLETED FOR ALL CUSTOMERS, THE GAS MAINS WERE PURGED AND THE GAS WAS TURNED BACK ON AT 8:15 PM. THE FIRST CUSTOMER WAS RE-LIT AT 8:30 PM AND A FIRST PASS TO RE-LITE ALL 135 CUSTOMERS WAS COMPLETED AT 11:45 PM.

AT AROUND 8:30 AM, A CASS LAKE SCHOOL SYSTEM EMPLOYEE NOTED GAS LEAKING FROM THE SERVICE RELIEF VALVE AT THE CASS LAKE HIGH SCHOOL.  HE REPORTED THIS TO HIS SUPERVISOR, PETE RAIRDON (AT HOME AT THE TIME).  MR. TOLD HIS EMPLOYEE THAT HE ( MR. RAIRDON) WAS ON HIS WAY TO HELP AND ALSO INSTRUCTED HIS EMPLOYEE TO CALL THE CASS LAKE FIRE DEPARTMENT IN CASE THE PROBLEM WAS MORE THAN THE TWO OF THEM COULD HANDLE.    AT 9:12 AM JACK PALKKI (NW GAS ON-CALL TECHNICIAN) RECEIVED A CALL FROM THE CASS COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT DISPATCHER THAT THE CASS LAKE FIRE DEPARTMENT WAS ON-SITE AT THE CASS LAKE HIGH SCHOOL AND THAT THERE WAS AN OUTDOOR GAS LEAK REPORTED.  JACK ASKED FOR AN ON-SITE CONTACT NUMBER WHICH HE WAS GIVEN AND WHEN HE MADE CONTACT WITH THE ON-SITE PERSONNEL LEARNED THAT THE GAS WAS NOW OFF AND THE SITUATION AT THE SCHOOL WAS SAFE.    JACK THEN CALLED JOE ROY (NW GAS AREA SUPERVISOR) TO CONFER ABOUT WHAT WOULD LIKELY BE NEEDED TO RETURN THE SCHOOL SERVICE TO OPERATION.  AT THIS POINT THE SUSPICION WAS A FAILED SERVICE REGULATOR AND THE DISCUSSION REFLECTED THAT.    A SECOND CALL FROM THE SHERIFF'S DISPATCHER REPORTING GAS LEAKING FROM THE SERVICE RELIEF VALVE AT THE CASINO PROMPTED JACK AND JOE TO SUSPECT A LARGER PROBLEM AND TO GET JACK GOING IMMEDIATELY TO CASS LAKE.  THE GAS WAS REPORTED SHUT OFF AT THE CASINO WHICH TERMINATED THE LEAK THERE AS WELL.    AT THIS POINT, JOE RECEIVED A CALL FROM GARY LINDSTROM, THE CASS LAKE AREA GREAT LAKES GAS TRANSMISSION COMPANY FIELD TECHNICIAN, THAT A NEIGHBOR TO THE TBS LOCATION HAD REPORTED A HISSING SOUND AND THAT MR. LINDSTROM WAS ENROUTE (1/2 HOUR TRAVEL).  JOE GAVE MR. LINDSTROM JACK'S CELL NUMBER SO THAT THE TWO FIELD TECHS COULD COMMUNICATE.    JACK RECEIVED A CALL AT 11:07 FROM MR. LINDSTROM, WHO HAD JUST ARRIVED AT THE CASS LAKE TBS SITE, REPORTING THAT THERE WAS INDEED GAS ESCAPING FROM OUR SYSTEM'S TATTLE-TALE RELIEF VALVE AND THAT THE ESCAPING GAS HAD IGNITED.  JACK INSTRUCTED MR. LINDSTROM TO CALL THE CASS LAKE FIRE DEPARTMENT, WHICH MR. LINDSTROM DID.  AT THIS POINT, JACK WAS VERY CLOSE TO THE SITE AND ARRIVED BEFORE THE FIRE DEPARTMENT DID.  THE FIRE DEPARTMENT ALSO REPORTED THAT THEY HAD TURNED OFF A THIRD SERVICE (AT MAUREEN MOOSE'S RESIDENCE) DUE TO GAS LEAKAGE FROM THE REGULATOR RELIEF OPENING.    ALTHOUGH THERE WERE NO ACCESSIBLE PRESSURE GAUGES PRESENT WHICH COULD BE USED TO VERIFY THE DISTRIBUTION PIPELINE PRESSURE, JACK DETERMINED THAT IT WOULD BE BEST TO REDUCE THE PRESSURE IN OUR PIPELINE, SO HE TURNED OFF A GREAT LAKES VALVE TO ACCOMPLISH THIS.  AT THIS POINT JOE ROY CALLED MIKE GORHAM, OWNER OF THE SYSTEM TO ADVISE HIM OF THE EVENTS GOING ON AND THAT JOE WAS ENROUTE TO CASS LAKE.  JOE ALSO CALLED STEVE MCNIFF (ANOTHER NW GAS FIELD TECH) TO GET HIM MOVING TO CASS LAKE.  MIKE PROCEEDED TO ACT AS THE INCIDENT RESPONSE LEADER COORDINATING THE RESPONSE FROM THAT POINT.    WITH THE GAS TURNED OFF AT THE GREAT LAKES END AND THE PRESSURE IN THE PIPELINE FALLING, MIKE ASKED JACK TO ARRANGE FOR A FIREMAN IN TURNOUT GEAR TO APPROACH THE STILL-DISCHARGING RELIEF VALVE AND TURN IT OFF IF THAT OPERATION COULD BE SAFELY ACCOMPLISHED IN TURNOUT GEAR.  THE FIREMAN AGREED AND THE GAS WAS SHUT OFF, WHICH EXTINGUISHED ALMOST ALL OF THE FIRE, THE ONLY REMNANT BEING GAS ESCAPING FROM THE SECOND-STAGE REGULATOR PILOT ON THE WEST REGULATOR RUN, WHICH WAS THEN ISOLATED USING THE INSTALLED ISOLATION VALVES.  THIS ELIMINATION OF THE FIRE HAZARD ALLOWED FOR THE INSERTION OF A PRESSURE GAUGE IN THE DISTRIBUTION PIPELINE.  THE INITIAL READING OF THIS GAUGE WAS JUST UNDER 110 PSIG.    AT THIS POINT, MIKE DIRECTED JOE TO STOP FIRST AT THE REPORTED GAS-OFF SITES TO RESTORE SERVICE.  SERVICE WAS SUCCESSFULLY RESTORED.    THE FIRE DEPARTMENT WAS RELEASED FROM ALL OF THE RESPONSE SITES.  THE NW GAS RESPONSE NOW TURNED TO PRESE"

A CODE MURRE (MULTIPLE RESOURCE RESPONSE EVENT) WAS INITIATED AND GAS DISTRIBUTION SERVICES (GDS), NUMEROUS SUPERVISORS, CONSTRUCTION, PHOTOGRAPHER, CHEM LAB, EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AND ELECTRIC #9 WERE DISPATCHED. AT 08:16 A CONSTRUCTION SUPERVISOR ARRIVED ON LOCATION, AND CONFIRMED THE COLLAPSE WITH SIGNIFICANT FDNY, NYPD, & EMS RESPONSE. THE FDNY WAS IN THE COLLAPSED BUILDING ATTEMPTING TO SECURE AN OPEN-ENDED GAS PIPE. GERC SUPPLIED THE CURB VALVE LOCATION FOR 1300 BLONDELL AVE, AS 2601 WESTCHESTER AVE HAD NO DIRECT GAS SERVICE. THE GAS SUPPLY PIPE TO A CEILING MOUNTED SPACE HEATER HAD BEEN DAMAGED BY FALLING DEBRIS RESULTING IN GAS FREELY BLOWING INTO THE ATMOSPHERE. AT 08:22 THE FDNY TEMPORARILY SECURED THE OPEN-ENDED HOUSE PIPE WITH TAPE. AT 08:24 THE CURB VALVE WAS CLOSED SECURING THE LEAK. AT 08:27 GDS VERIFIED A 100% SHUTDOWN FROM THE 1.25"" LOW PRESSURE POLYETHYLENE CURB VALVE. AT 08:46 THE ELECTRIC SERVICE WAS DE-ENERGIZED TO THE BUILDING. CHANNEL 12 NEWS REPORTED THAT A ONE STORY AUTO BODY SHOP COLLAPSED DUE TO AN AIR COMPRESSOR EXPLOSION INSIDE THE BUILDING; ADDITIONAL REPORTS ON-SITE AND IN THE MEDIA STATED A GARAGE COMPRESSOR EXPLODED CAUSING THE BUILDING TO COLLAPSE. NO FIRE CONDITION WAS DETECTED PER FDNY CHIEF SAKOVICH. TWO OCCUPANTS, A FATHER AND SON (BENEDETTO MONDELLO - DOB-7/16/1950, BENJAMIN MONDELLO - DOB- 3/8/1978) WERE TAKEN BY EMS TO JACOBI HOSPITAL DUE TO INJURIES SUSTAINED IN THE EXPLOSION. FDNY CHIEF SEELIG INITIALLY REPORTED THE CAUSE OF THE EXPLOSION WAS UNDER INVESTIGATION.   INITIAL LEAK INVESTIGATIONS DETECTED NO GAS ODOR OR READINGS IN THE BUILDINGS ACCESSED AS WELL AS IN SUBSURFACE STRUCTURES. A POGO SURVEY OF THE IMMEDIATE AREA BY GDS DETECTED NO OUTSIDE READINGS. LEAK SURVEY RESPONDED AND PERFORMED SEVERAL LEAK SURVEYS OF THE AREA SURROUNDING THE INCIDENT. THE INITIAL SURVEY AT 09:10 DETECTED NO READINGS BUT A SECOND SURVEY AT 09:50 DETECTED 4.4% AT THE OUTSIDE FOUNDATION WALL OF 1314 COOPER AVE. THE FDNY PROVIDED ACCESS AND 2% WAS DETECTED IN THE ELECTRIC POINT OF ENTRY AT THE INSIDE FOUNDATION WALL. 1320 COOPER AVE WAS CHECKED AND FOUND CLEAR, AND SB 24280 SUPPLYING #1314 WAS CHECKED AND 60% READING WAS RECEIVED. THE COVER WAS PULLED TO VENT THE STRUCTURE. SB 22786 WAS CHECKED AND 58% WAS DETECTED AND THE COVER PULLED TO VENT THE STRUCTURE; ADJACENT MANHOLES M10930 AND M23142 WERE FOUND CLEAR. A BAR HOLE SURVEY DETECTED 40%-90% GAS READINGS OVER THE 6"" LPCI 1952 MAIN ON COOPER AVE.

THE ROOT CAUSE WAS THE FAILURE OF HOPE GAS REGULATORS DUE TO ICING CONDITIONS.  THESE REGULATORS ARE LOCATED IN STATION HX-363 AND REDUCE PRESSURE FROM OVER 500 PSIG TO 70 PSIG.    AT 06:47, A SERVICE PIPELINE THAT IS CONNECTED TO M-3095 RUPTURED, CAUSING A BLOWING LEAK.  THE SYSTEM WAS ISOLATED AND COMPLETELY SHUT DOWN AT 8:10.  NO INJURIES OR PROPERTY DAMAGE OCCURRED.    A CONSULTANT (JANA LABORATORIES, INC.) WAS EMPLOYED TO ANALYZE THE INCIDENT AND RECOMMEND CHANGES.  AS ADVISED BY JANA LABS' PRELIMINARY REPORT, DOMINION HOPE GAS IS IN THE PROCESS OF INSPECTING AND/OR REPLACING VARIOUS COMPONENTS OF THE AFFECTED PIPELINE SYSTEM.  TESTING OF THE PIPELINES AND THE REGULATING/METERING STATIONS WILL BE PERFORMED IN ACCORDANCE WITH 46 CFR PART 192.  THE SYSTEM WILL BE PLACED INTO SERVICE ONLY WHEN ALL COMPONENTS ARE DEEMED SAFE AND OPERATIONAL.    AS REQUESTED BY DOMINION, JANA LABORATORIES IS COMPILING AN ADDITIONAL REPORT TO RECOMMEND LONG-RANGE PLANS AND CONCERNS.    COMPLETION INFORMATION:    A CONSULTANT (JANA LABORATORIES) COMPLETED AN EVALUATION OF THE AFFECTED PIPELINE SYSTEM:    5.0 RECOMMENDATIONS  BASED ON THE ANALYSIS TO DATE AND THE TESTING OF THE SAMPLES RECEIVED, THE FOLLOWING  RECOMMENDATIONS ARE MADE:  &#61623; THE OVERPRESSURIZATION RESULTED IN THE EXPOSURE OF THREE REGULATOR STATIONS, THE HDPE  MAINLINE, AND THE MDPE BRANCH TO INCREASING PRESSURE UP TO >500 PSIG (MAXIMUM 528 PSIA,  OR 513 PSIG), RAMPING UP OVER A PERIOD OF APPROXIMATELY ONE HOUR. THE ROOT CAUSE WAS  REPORTEDLY THE FAILURE OF REGULATOR STATION HX-363 TO REGULATE PRESSURE FROM THE TRANSMISSION  LINE DUE TO FROZEN WATER IN THE REGULATOR RUN.  &#61623; THE INTEGRITY OF THE PIPES AND FITTINGS HAS BEEN ASSESSED AS FOLLOWS:  O 6"" HDPE PIPE AND ASSOCIATED HEAT FUSION, ELECTROFUSION, AND TRANSITION FITTINGS: NO  EXPECTED IMPACT OF OVERPRESSURIZATION ON LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE  O 6"" HDPE BALL VALVES: NO EXPECTED IMPACT OF OVERPRESSURIZATION ON LONG-TERM  PERFORMANCE  O 4"" MDPE PIPE AND ASSOCIATED HEAT FUSION, ELECTROFUSION, AND TRANSITION FITTINGS  AFFECTED (PIPE BURST); NON-BURST REGIONS EXPOSED TO PRESSURE CLOSE TO TENSILE LIMIT  O 4"" MDPE BALL VALVE: POSSIBLY AFFECTED; EXPOSED TO PRESSURE CLOSE TO TENSILE LIMIT  &#61623; THE INTEGRITY OF THE REGULATOR STATIONS HAS BEEN ASSESSED AS FOLLOWS:  O HX-363: NOT EXPECTED TO BE AFFECTED; ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS OF ENTRAINED WATER FREEZING  ADVISED BEFORE REPRESSURIZATION  O TYGART VALLEY REGIONAL JAIL: POSSIBLY AFFECTED; METER, VALVES, AND REGULATORS EXPOSED TO  PRESSURE > MAOP  O IS-267: POSSIBLY AFFECTED; METER, VALVES AND REGULATORS EXPOSED TO PRESSURE > MAOP  &#61623; ALL POTENTIALLY AFFECTED COMPONENTS SHOULD BE CLOSELY EXAMINED FOR DAMAGE (IN SIMILAR  FASHION TO HX-363 AFTER THE INCIDENT) AND REPLACED IF DAMAGE IS FOUND. IT HAS BEEN INDICATED  THAT THE JAIL REGULATOR STATION AND THE ENTIRE MDPE LINE ARE SCHEDULED TO BE REPLACED..    1 . REGULATORS WERE COMPLETED DISASSEMBLED AND INSPECTED AT ALL THREE STATIONS BY A CONSULTANT (MASTER CONTROLS).       REGULATORS WERE FOUND TO BE UNAFFECTED BY THE OVERPRESSURE SITUATION.  2   TWIN 3X4 MERCER RELIEF VALVES WERE INSTALLED AS ADDITIONAL OVER-PRESSURE PROTECTION AT THE HIGH PRESSURE CUT REGULATION STATION.  3.  BRUEST PILOT HEATERS WERE INSTALLED ON THE HIGH PRESSURE CUT REGULATION STATION.  4.  NEW STEEL ENAMEL BUILDING INSTALLED OVER THE HIGH PRESSURE CUT REGULATION STATION TO PROTECT HEATERS FROM THE WIND.  5.  MDPE PIPE WAS REMOVED AND REPLACE WITH HDPE.  6.  ENTIRE SYSTEM WAS RETESTED WITH AIR TO 155 LBS.  7.  COMPLETE STATION INSPECTIONS WERE PERFORMED WHEN GAS WAS REINTRODUCED.     GAS WAS REINTRODUCED ON 11/25/13."

PER THE CONTRACTOR'S ONE CALL REQUEST, HG RESPONDED AND MARKED THE LOCATION OF ITS FACILITY.  USING THE TONING MARKS BY HG AND ITS OWN EQUIPMENT, CONTRACTOR ATTEMPTED TO CONFIRM THE LOCATION OF THE GAS MAIN BEFORE DRILLING.  HG WAS ADVISED THAT THE CONTRACTOR ATTEMPTED TO AVOID DAMAGING OUR LINE BY DRILLING MORE THAN 30 INCHES HORIZONTALLY FROM THE PIPE LOCATION TONING MARK AND TEST BORING USING A NON-POWERED AUGER BEFORE USE OF THE POWERED DRILL RIG.    THE GAS MAIN WAS APPROXIMATELY 10 FEET DEEP WHEN THE CONTRACTOR'S POWERED DRILLING RIG HIT IT.  HG DISPATCHED A CREW TO BEGIN EXCAVATING TO INSTALL LINE STOP FITTINGS.  DUE TO THE PIPE'S DEPTH, HG HAD DIFFICULTY LOCATING AND EXPOSING THE DAMAGED SECTION OF THE LINE WHERE THE REPAIR WORK WOULD NEED TO BE DONE AND HALTED WORK AFTER SEVERAL HOURS OF EXCAVATING.  TWO PERSONNEL REMAINED ON SITE OVERNIGHT TO MONITOR THE LEAK.    ON 9/24/13, A NEW LOCATION WITH IMPROVED ACCESS TO THE GAS MAIN WAS SELECTED.  AT 10:00 AM, THE FEDERAL FIRE DEPARTMENT EVACUATED SEVERAL BUILDINGS IN THE NEARBY NAVAL HOUSING AREA AS A PRECAUTION DUE TO THE DETECTION OF GAS.  HG LEAK INSPECTORS PERFORMED BELOW GRADE STRUCTURE CHECKS AND DETECTED 100% GAS READINGS IN SEVERAL MANHOLES.  AS A RESULT, HG SET UP BLOWERS TO VENTILATE THE MANHOLES TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF ITS CREW AND THE GENERAL PUBLIC.    BASED ON OUR INVESTIGATION, HG BELIEVES THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT WAS THE CONTRACTOR'S INABILITY TO ACCURATELY LOCATE THE PIPE PRIOR TO COMMENCING DRILLING."

AS PART OF THE INCIDENT RESPONSE, A GAS SERVICE WORKER CHECKED THE HOME ACROSS THE STREET FROM THE FAILURE POINT, AND PERFORMED ADDITIONAL BAR TESTS WITHIN THE SOIL NEAR THE FAILURE.  NONE OF THESE TESTS FOUND ANY GAS MIGRATION.  ALL THE GAS WAS VENTING TO ATMOSPHERE DIRECTLY ABOVE THE POINT OF FAILURE.    THE POINT OF FAILURE ON THE MAIN WAS UNDER A COUNTY DRAIN DITCH, APPROXIMATELY 20' BELOW THE ROAD GRADE AND UNDER 14' OF SOIL.  THE MAIN WAS CAPPED ON EACH SIDE OF THE FAILURE UPON SHUTOFF.    THE FAILURE POINT WAS LATER EXTRACTED AND ANALYZED, REVEALING A FAILED BUTT FUSE JOINT.  INADEQUATE FUSE BEAD ROLLOVER WAS OBSERVED ON ONE SIDE OF THE FUSE, INDICATING POSSIBLE INCOMPLETE FACING PRIOR TO UTILIZING THE HYDRAULIC BUTT FUSE MACHINE.  THE NON-FUSED ZONE WAS CHARACTERIZED BY A GENERALLY SMOOTH FLAT SURFACE APPEARANCE, AS WELL AS PARALLEL CUT MARKS WHICH LIKELY INDICATE THAT THE SURFACE HAD NOT BEEN HEATED TO THE MELTING POINT DURING THE JOINT FUSION OPERATION.    INITIAL ESTIMATES INDICATED THAT MORE THAN 3 MMCF OF GAS MAY HAVE BEEN RELEASED DURING THE LEAK, BUT REVISED FINDINGS (BASED ON OBSERVATIONS OF THE FAILED FUSE; SEE ATTACHED), INDICATE A GAS RELEASE OF LESS THAN 1 MMCF.  A SUPPLEMENTAL PHMSA INCIDENT REPORT IS BEING SUBMITTED HEREWITH TO REFLECT THIS, AND ALSO REFLECT THE COSTS INCURRED DURING REPLACEMENT AND INVESTIGATION OF THE FAILED MAIN."

ONLY ONE INDIVIDUAL WAS IN THE OPEN EXCAVATION AT THE TIME OF THE IGNITION. THE FIRE WAS IMMEDIATELY EXTINGUISHED BY THE SECOND CREW MEMBER. THE CREW MEMBER SUBJECTED TO THE IGNITION IMMEDIATELY EXITED THE EXCAVATION. HE THEN REMOVED HIS NOMEX HOOD AND OTHER FIRE RESISTANT CLOTHING AND SAFETY APPAREL. HE WAS GIVEN FIRST AID AND 911 WAS CALLED.      AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE CAUSE OF INCIDENT HAS BEEN CONDUCTED AND CAN NOT ASCERTAIN THE CAUSE WITH ANY REASONALBLE DEGREE OF CERTAINTY.     COLUMBIA GAS OF OHIO'S THIRD PARTY CAUSE AND ORIGIN INVESTIGATORS WERE ABLE TO DETERMINE THAT THERE WERE TWO POTENTIAL SOURCES OF IGNITION IN THE EXCAVATION AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT; A PNEUMATIC SCALER AND AN ELECTRIC WATER PUMP.  THE DAMAGE TO THE ELECTRIC WATER PUMP'S WIRING AND PROTECTIVE BOOT ALLOWED ARCING WHICH IS LIKELY THE IGNITION SOURCE OF THIS INCIDENT.  THERE IS PHYSICAL EVIDENCE THAT SUGGESTS THE CONDITION OF THE PROTECTIVE BOOT WAS COMPROMISED PRIOR TO THE INCIDENT. IN ORDER TO ELIMINATE THE POTENTIAL FOR RECURRENCE COLUMBIA GAS OF OHIO INC. HAS PROHIBITED THE USE OF THESE WATER PUMPS BY ALL REPAIR CREWS AND IS ACTIVELY SEEKING A REPLACEMENT WATER PUMP WHICH IS NOT ELECTRICALLY DRIVEN.  IN ADDITION, WHILE THE INVESTIGATION DID NOT INDICATE THAT THE INCIDENT WAS NOT CAUSED BY THE SCALER, COLUMBIA IS ALSO ISSUING A SAFETY BULLETIN TO OUR MAINTENANCE CREWS ADVISING THEM TO ENSURE A COBALT PISTONS ARE BEING UTILIZED.     PLEASE CONSIDER THIS COLUMBIA'S FINAL REPORT ON THIS INCIDENT."

HEARTLAND MIDWEST, LLC FAILED TO PROPERLY VERIFY THE LOCATION OF THE GAS MAIN BY TEST-HOLE (POT-HOLING).  THE INCIDENT IS STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION, SO THERE MAY BE OTHER FAILURES IDENTIFIED.  MGE IS STILL INVESTIGATING TO DETERMINE WHAT TIME THE GAS MAIN WAS ACTUALLY STRUCK BY THE DIRECTIONAL DRILLING EQUIPMENT. IN REFERENCE TO PART A, QUESTION 16, MGE GAVE EVACUATION ORDERS TO TWO STRUCTURES (906 AND 910 W 48TH STREET).    THE EXPLOSION AT JJ'S RESTAURANT, 910 W. 48TH STREET, KANSAS CITY, MO, OCCURRED AT APPROXIMATELY 18:04.  THE TWO-INCH VALVE AT THE NW CORNER OF 48TH AND ROANOKE (ON 48TH STREET) WAS CLOSED AT APPROXIMATELY 19:20.  THEN, THE TWO-INCH PE GAS MAIN WAS PINCHED OFF AT THE SE CORNER OF 48TH AND BELLEVIEW (ON BELLEVIEW) AT APPROXIMATELY 20:00.  AFTER THE GAS FLOW WAS ELIMINATED, THE WEST END OF THE GAS MAIN ON 48TH STREET WAS CUT AND CAPPED ON THE NE CORNER OF 48TH AND BELLEVIEW, AND THE EAST END OF THE GAS MAIN WAS CUT AND CAPPED JUST WEST OF THE TWO-INCH VALVE AT THE NW CORNER OF 48TH AND ROANOKE.  THEN, THE GAS MAIN ON BELLEVIEW WAS RE-ENERGIZED TO ALLOW GAS FLOW TO CUSTOMERS ON BELLEVIEW BETWEEN 48TH AND 47TH STREETS.  THE GAS MAIN ON 48TH STREET BETWEEN BELLEVIEW AND ROANOKE IS STILL INACTIVE, INCLUDING THE SERVICE LINES TO 906 AND 910 W. 48TH STREET.    THERE WAS ONE FATALITY AND MULTIPLE INJURIES AS A RESULT OF THE EXPLOSION.  MGE'S FIRST RESPONDER WAS SERIOUSLY INJURED.  MGE ALSO UNDERSTANDS THAT EMPLOYEES OF HEARTLAND MIDWEST AND JJ'S RESTAURANT WERE INJURED, BUT THE EXACT NUMBER OF INJURIES IS UNKNOWN AT THIS TIME.  THERE WAS ALSO SIGNIFICANT PROPERTY DAMAGE, BUT THE TOTAL ESTIMATED PROPERTY DAMAGE IS UNKNOWN AT THIS TIME.    MGE HAD SIX EMPLOYEES ON SITE AT THE TIME OF THE EXPLOSION.  SINCE MGE WAS UNABLE TO COMPLETE A FULL INVESTIGATION ON THE NIGHT OF THE INCIDENT TO DETERMINE WHETHER ANY OF ITS ON-SITE EMPLOYEES CONTRIBUTED TO THE INCIDENT, FIVE OF THE SIX EMPLOYEES WERE SENT TO THE HOSPITAL LATER THAT EVENING OUT OF AN ABUNDANCE OF CAUTION FOR DOT POST-ACCIDENT DRUG AND ALCOHOL TESTING.  THE HOSPITAL WAS INSTRUCTED TO ADMINISTER DOT POST-ACCIDENT DRUG AND ALCOHOL TESTING FOR ALL FIVE EMPLOYEES.  BOTH DRUG AND ALCOHOL TESTS WERE ADMINISTERED TO FOUR OF THE EMPLOYEES, WITH NO POSITIVE RESULTS.  A DRUG TEST WAS ADMINISTERED TO THE FIFTH EMPLOYEE WITH NO POSITIVE RESULTS.  THE HOSPITAL WAS INSTRUCTED TO ADMINISTER AN ALCOHOL TEST TO THE FIFTH EMPLOYEE, BUT DID NOT.  THE SIXTH EMPLOYEE, MGE'S FIRST RESPONDER WHO WAS SERIOUSLY INJURED, WAS IN THE ICU AFTER THE INCIDENT AND IT IS UNKNOWN AT THIS TIME WHETHER HE UNDERWENT POST-ACCIDENT DRUG AND ALCOHOL TESTING AS PART OF HIS MEDICAL TREATMENT.  AS OF THE DATE OF THIS REPORT, MGE DOES NOT BELIEVE ITS EMPLOYEES' PERFORMANCE CONTRIBUTED TO THE INCIDENT.  MGE UNDERSTANDS THAT ITS FIRST RESPONDER WAS TESTED FOR ALCOHOL AND DRUGS AFTER THE INCIDENT IN THE COURSE OF THE TREATMENT FOR HIS INJURIES AT ST. LUKE'S HOSPITAL, AND THAT THE RESULTS WERE NEGATIVE."

THE ANALYSIS SHOWS THE FAILURE OF THE CIRCUMFERENTIAL GROOVE WELD TO BE THE RESULT OF EXTERNAL LOADS EXCEEDING THE CAPABILITIES OF A WELD JOINT THAT EXHIBITED COMPLETE LACK OF PENETRATION SINCE ITS INSTALLATION IN 1931.  EXTERNAL CORROSION WAS NOT A FACTOR, SINCE NONE WAS OBSERVED, INDICATING THE WRAPPING AND CATHODIC PROTECTION OF THIS PIPE WERE SATISFACTORY.  THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE FAILURE WAS INCOMPLETE PENETRATION OF THE WELD METAL JOINING THE TWO PIPES. HOWEVER, THE WELD WAS SUFFICIENTLY STRONG TO REMAIN IN SERVICE FOR OVER 80 YEARS."

HFD DISPATCHER ADVISED THAT THEY RECEIVED A REPORT OF A ""BOOM"" FOLLOWED BY FIRE.  GAS WAS SMELLED IN THE AREA AND OUR CREWS WERE URGENTLY REQUESTED.    OPERATOR EMERGENCY RESPONDERS FROM HU GAS DEPARTMENT ARRIVED ON SITE AT 2230 (10:30PM CST) ON JANUARY 15, 2013.  HFD AND THE HUNTSVILLE POLICE DEPARTMENT (HPD) WERE ON SITE AND HAD EXTINGUISHED A FIRE AT THE PUBLIC HOUSING DWELLING UNIT AT 851 UNIT C WASHINGTON ST AND SECURED THE AREA.  UPON SMELLING NATURAL GAS THE EMERGENCY RESPONDERS CALLED FOR ADDITIONAL HELP TO LOCATE THE SOURCE OF THE APPARENT GAS LEAK.    CREWS WERE CALLED IN AND WERE SUCCESSFUL IN SHUTTING OFF THE SUPPLY OF GAS TO THE ENTIRE PUBLIC HOUSING PROJECT AT 0230 (2:30AM CST) ON JANUARY 16, 2013.  IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT AN UNDERGROUND STEEL DISTRIBUTION VALVE, 2 INCH IN DIAMETER, HAD A CRACKED FLANGE.  THIS LEAK WAS REPAIRED BY REMOVING THE VALVE ALONG WITH ANOTHER SIMILIAR VALVE AND REPLACING IT WITH COATED STEEL PIPE.  THE LEAK WAS TWENTY FEET AWAY FROM THE DWELLING AT 851 WASHINGTON ST.  GAS SERVICE WAS THEN RESTORED TO THE AREA AT 0745 (7:45AM CST) ON JANUARY 16, 2013.      AFTER THE LEAK WAS REPAIRED HU GAS DEPARTMENT CREWS BEGAN TO CONDUCT A NUMBER OF TESTS IN THE VICINTY OF 851 WASHINGTON ST.  THESE TESTS INCLUDED A LEAK SURVEY, CATHODIC PROTECTION PIPE TO SOIL READINGS, BAR HOLE TEST AND A PRESSURE TEST OF ALL THREE GAS SERVICE LINES TO 851 WASHINGTON ST., AS THIS BUILDING WAS A TRI-PLEX COMPRISED OF UNITS A, B, AND C.  ALL THREE GAS SERVICES HELD THE TEST PRESSURE OF APPROXIMATLY +125 PSIG WITH NO LEAKS INDICATED.  A TEST OF THE FUEL LINE (CUSTOMER PIPING) AT UNIT C FAILED, INDICATING A LEAK INSIDE THE UNIT.    AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT IS ON GOING.  CONTRIBUTING FACTOR(S) MAY HAVE BEEN THE LEAK ON THE FUEL LINE, THE UNDERGROUND GAS LEAK OR SOME OTHER FACTOR.    THE LOCAL WEATHER CONDITIONS AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT WERE A TEMPERATURE OF 37 DEGREES FARENHEIT,  THE WIND SPEED WAS 5 MPH, NO WIND GUSTS, WIND DIRECTION WAS 300 (GENERALLY OUT OF THE NORTHWEST).  IT WAS OVERCAST WITH A LIGHT RAINFALL.    A SUPPLEMENTAL OR SUPPLEMENTAL PLUS FINAL REPORT WILL BE FILED AS SOON AS NEW, UPDATED AND/OR CORRECTED INFORMATION IS KNOWN.    SEPTEMBER 8, 2016-THIS IS A SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT RELATED TO THIS INCIDENT. EXPERT WITNESSES DETERMINED THAT SOMETHING HEAVY LIKE A VEHICLE RAN OVER A VALVE BOX CAUSING DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON A 2 INCH FLANGED ROCKWELL FIGURE 143 VALVE CAUSING THE VALVE TO CRACK IN A FLANGE. GAS THEN MIGRATED ALONG A DITCH LINE INTO THE DWELLING CAUSING AN EXPLOSION AND FIRE."

THE FIRE DEPARTMENT HAD EXTINGUISHED THE FIRE PRIOR TO THE SERVICE TECHNICIAN ARRIVING.  THE SERVICE TECHNICIAN REMOVED THE METER AND INSTALLED A RUBBER STOPPER ON THE RISER TO STOP THE GAS LEAK.  THE METER SET WAS INSTALLED ON THE EXTERIOR OF THE WATER HEATER ENCLOSURE.    THE FIRE DESTROYED THE WATER HEATER ENCLOSURE AND BURNED THE EXTERIOR SIDING ON THE 2ND FLOOR.  AS A RESULT OF HFD EXTINGUISHING THE FIRE, 2 UNITS SUSTAINED WATER DAMAGE.    BYSTANDERS REPORTED SEEING KIDS STANDING ON THE METER SET AND JUMPING TO THE FENCE.  THIS WOULD BE A PLAUSIBLE EXPLANATION WHY THE METER SET WAS LEANING TO THE LEFT SIDE AND COULD BE THE CAUSE OF THE CRACKED NIPPLE.    THE 3/4"" GALVANIZED RISER WAS IN GOOD CONDITION WITH NO NOTICABLE CORROSION.    ACCORDING TO THE HONOLULU FIRE DEPARTMENT'S INCIDENT REPORT (2013-0001443-000), THE ESTIMATED PROPERTY DAMAGE IS $35,000.  THE REPORT ALSO NOTES THE PROBABLE CAUSE WAS SOMEONE STEPPED ONTO THE LEFT SIDE OF THE METER ASSEMBLY TRYING TO GET OVER A 6 FOOT WOODEN FENCE.  THE WEIGHT OF THE PERSON CAUSED THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE PIPING TO CRACK OPEN, WHICH CREATED A LARGE GAS LEAK.

THIS RESIDENCE IS A GARAGE APARTMENT BEHIND 410 59TH ST., WEST PALM BEACH, FL. THE SERVICE TECH FROM FLORIDA PUBLIC UTILTIES ARRIVED AT 11:59 AM AND FOUND THE NATURAL GAS SERVICE TO 410 59TH ST. TURNED OFF AT THE METER BY THE FIRE DEPARTMENT AS THEY WERE EXTINGUISHING THE FIRE.  THE TECH FOUND THE 3/4"" BARE STEEL NATURAL GAS SERVICE LEAKING UNDER A CONCRETE SLAB AT THE RESIDENCE. FLORIDA PUBLIC UTLITIES DISPATCHED A DISTRIBUTION CREW TO CUT THE SERVICE AT THE MAIN AND CAP IT AT 1:00 PM ON 8/28/12.  IT WAS DETERMINED THAT AS A RESULT OF TROPICAL STORM ISAAC, THERE WERE MULTIPLE LIGHTENING STRIKES IN THE AREA OF THE RESIDENCE ON FRIDAY, 8/24/12. NEWS REPORTS STATED THAT THE RESIDENT OF 410.5 59TH ST., WEST PALM BEACH STARTED SMELLING GAS AROUND THIS TIME. HE DID NOT NOTIFY FLORIDA PUBLIC UTILITIES BUT LOOKED FOR THE SOURCE OF THE ODOR HIMSELF ON TUESDAY, 8/28/12.  ATTACHED TO THIS REPORT IS A PICTURE OF A SECTION OF 3/4"" BARE STEEL SERVICE THAT WAS CUT AND CAPPED AT 410 59TH ST., WEST PALM BEACH. IT APPEARS TO HAVE A HOLE CAUSED BY AN ELECTRICAL ARC.    FURTHER INVESTIGATION OF THIS INCIDENT IN THE FOLLOWING WEEKS DETERMINIED THAT THE 3/4"" BS GAS SERVICE WAS IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO A CAST IRON SEWER LINE AND A GALVANIZED ELECTRICAL CONDUIT. THE ELECTRICAL CONDUIT WAS INSTALLED AT SOME POINT AFTER THE GAS SERVICE WAS INSTALLED WHEN THE GARAGE WAS CONVERTED INTO AN APARTMENT AND A CONCRETE SLAB WAS POURED OVER THEM ON THE GROUND.    STRAY CURRENT EITHER FROM AN ELECTIC POWER POLE OR INDUCED UPON THE  CONDUIT AND PIPING CAUSED AN ARC BETWEEN THE CONDUIT AND PIPES RESULTING IN A SMALL HOLE IN THE GAS PIPING. GAS LEAKED UNDER THE SLAB AS A RESULT OF THE ARC HOLE BEGINNING ON 8/24/12 AND VENTED INTO THE GARAGE APARTMENT. WHEN THE RESIDENT OF 410 59TH ST. BEGAN TO LOOK FOR THE SOURCE OF THE ODOR ON 8/28/12, HE LIT A CIGARETTE, IGNITING THE GAS IN THE APARTMENT.      5/28/2015 - SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION TO THE SUPPLEMENTAL AND FINAL REPORT FILED ON 4/28/2014.   1. THE LONGITUDE AND LATITUDE COORDINATES WERE CORRECTED FROM THE ORIGINAL COORDINATES THAT WERE OBTAINED FROM GOOGLE MAPS AND WERE SLIGHTLY INACCURATE.  2. THE CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT WAS CHANGED FROM G2 - NATURAL FORCE DAMAGE (LIGHTNING) TO G4 - OTHER OUTSIDE FORCE DAMAGE (ELECTRICAL ARCING). ALTHOUGH THERE WAS LIGHTNING IN THE AREA DAYS PRIOR TO THE INCIDENT, THE EXACT SOURCE OF THE CURRENT THAT ARCED A HOLE IN THE GAS SERVICE COULD NOT BE DEFINITIVELY DETERMINED AFTER AN INVESTIGATION.  3. TOTAL ESTIMATED PROPERTY DAMAGE WAS REVIEWED AND LEFT AS STATED. THE DAMAGE AND REMOVAL OF DEBRIS WERE CONFINED TO AN UNPERMITTED AND UNINHABITED DETACHED GARAGE THAT HAD BEEN CONVERTED INTO AN APARTMENT. THE REPAIR OF THE GAS MAIN CONSISTED OF INSTALLING A STOP FITTING AND INSERTING APPROX. 100' OF STEEL MAIN WITH PE PIPE AND RUNNING APPROX. 33' OF PE SERVICE. THE ASSESSED VALUE FOR THE ENTIRE PROPERTY AT 410 59TH ST, WEST PALM BEACH WAS $75,210 WITH A MARKET VALUE OF $92,639 IN 2012. THE MEDICAL COSTS FOR THE INJURED PARTY WERE NOT INCLUDED IN THE PROPERTY DAMAGE AMOUNT.  4. REFERENCE TO ""ACTIVE LITIGATION"" WAS REMOVED FROM LAST NARRATIVE.  5.

THE FIRE IS STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION AND NO FINAL REPORT HAS BEEN COMPLETED BY THE FIRE DEPARTMENT OR THE FIRE MARSHAL.    UPDATED FEBRUARY 11, 2013:  THIS UPDATE IS BASED PRIMARILY ON THE MINNESOTA STATE FIRE MARSHAL'S INVESTIGATION REPORT.  WE AGREE WITH THE CONCLUSION IN THE REPORT THAT THE FIRE WAS ACCIDENTAL.  THE AREA OF ORIGIN FOR THE FIRE WAS INSIDE THE RESIDENCE.  THE FIRST MATERIAL THAT IGNITED WAS NATURAL GAS VAPORS THAT HAD LEECHED INTO THE RESIDENCE AFTER A GAS SERVICE LINE HAD BEEN CRACKED OR BROKEN.  THE SPECIFIC LOCATION OF THE LEAK COULD NOT BE DETERMINED BECAUSE THE RISER AND A SEGMENT OF THE SERVICE WERE DESTROYED IN THE FIRE.  WHILE THE EXACT IGNITION FACTOR IS NOT KNOWN, ANY APPLIANCE THAT WOULD CYCLE ON OR OFF WOULD LIKELY HAVE PROVIDED SUFFICIENT ENERGY TO IGNITE THE NATURAL GAS/AIR MIXTURE ONCE IT HAD REACHED THE LOWER EXPLOSIVE LIMIT.    WITH RESPECT TO THE BROKEN OR CRACKED GAS SERVICE LINE THAT RESULTED IN THE GAS LEAK, WE KNOW THAT ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS IN THE PRECEDING 4 YEARS, THE RESIDENT HAD FILLED A SINK-TYPE OF HOLE IN THE GROUND OUTSIDE THE HOME THAT WAS ABOVE THE GAS LINE AND NEAR THE METER.  THE SETTLING OF THE SOIL IN THAT HOLE COULD HAVE PUT STRESS ON THE GAS LINE.  IN ADDITION, IN THE DAY (OR DAYS) BEFORE THE FIRE, A MEMBER OF THE RESIDENT'S FAMILY HAD ADDED CLASS FIVE ROCK TO THE TOP OF THE SINK HOLE AREA AND THEN PACKED IT DOWN WITH A BOBCAT, WHICH MAY HAVE ADDED TO OR CREATED STRESS ON THE GAS LINE, POSSIBLY ENOUGH TO CRACK OR BREAK IT AT THAT TIME.  XCEL ENERGY DOES NOT HAVE RECORDS OF THIS CUSTOMER CONTACTING US FOR ASSISTANCE WITH THE SINK HOLE NEAR THE GAS LINE, OR MAKING US AWARE OF ANY RELATED PROBLEMS.  OUR RECORDS REVEAL THAT THE METER LOCATION AT THE TIME OF THE FIRE WAS NOT THE ORIGINAL LOCATION OF THE METER.   WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE METER WAS MOVED BY AN UNKNOWN PARTY, NOT XCEL ENERGY, TO MAKE ROOM FOR A GARAGE ADDITION ON THE WEST SIDE OF THE HOUSE APPROXIMATELY 2007.    THE SERVICE LINE TO THIS LOCATION WILL BE RUN AT THE REQUEST OF THE CUSTOMER AFTER HOME IS REBUILT."

THE WORK INCLUDED RETIRING AND IN SOME CASES REMOVING THE EXISTING LOW PRESSURE FACILITIES.  R&W BEGAN WORK ON THE PROJECT IN SEPTEMBER 2011.  ON THE DAY OF THE INCIDENT R&W WAS RETIRING A SECTION OF 12 INCH LOW PRESSURE STEEL GAS MAIN ON BROADWAY AT 1ST STREET IN WEST NYACK.  THE 12 INCH MAIN RUNS NORTH AND SOUTH ON BROADWAY AND HAD A RADIAL 4 INCH LOW PRESSURE STEEL MAIN COMING OFF TO THE WEST ON 1ST ST.  R&W EXCAVATED AND EXPOSED THE 12 INCH AND 4 INCH MAIN.   THE BALLOON STOPPERS WERE INFLATED TO 4 PSI TESTED FOR LEAKAGE AND HELD PRESSURE FOR OVER ONE HOUR BEFORE BEING USED.  THEY INSTALLED TWO TAPPING TEES AND FOUR LOW PRESSURE BALLOON STOPPERS INTO THE 12 INCH PIPE AT THE LOCATIONS SHOWN ON THE SKETCH.  THE 4 INCH MAIN HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN DEAD ENDED WITH A CAP FURTHER WEST ALONG 1ST STREET AND DID NOT REQUIRE ANY STOPPERS.  R&W THEN PERFORMED A FLOW TEST TO CONFIRM THAT GAS WAS BEING SUPPLIED TO THE MAIN NORTH AND SOUTH OF THE ISOLATED SECTION.  THE PRESSURE GAUGES ON THE BALLOON STOPPERS WERE CHECKED TO CONFIRM THAT THE STOPPERS WERE HOLDING AND THAT THE SECTION WAS EFFECTIVELY ISOLATED.  R&W CUT THE 12 INCH PIPE ON THE NORTH END OF THE EXCAVATION WITH A REED 4 WHEEL PIPE CUTTER.  THEY THEN MADE TWO CUTS WITH A DEMO SAW ON THE 4 INCH STEEL MAIN, REMOVING A 4 INCH RING.    R&W USED AN ORBITAL CUTTER AND TORCH TO BEVEL CUT THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE 12 INCH MAIN.   THE CREW MADE A SECOND CUT AND REMOVED ABOUT A 4 INCH RING AT THE SOUTHERLY END OF THE 12 INCH PIPE.  WHEN THE RINGS WERE CUT R&W HAD SUFFICIENT CLEARANCE AND THE CUT OUT SECTION WAS REMOVED FROM THE EXCAVATION.  R&W SET UP THE ORBITAL CUTTER TO BEVEL THE ROUGH CUT ON THE NORTH END OF THE 12 INCH MAIN.  THE CONTRACTOR'S WELDER AND CREW FOREMAN WERE IN THE EXCAVATION AND BEGAN TO MAKE THE BEVEL CUT.  AT 16:28, WHEN THEY HAD FLAME CUT APPROXIMATELY 8 INCHES OF THE CIRCUMFERENCE, THE NORTHERLY BALLOON STOPPERS FAILED AND THE LEAKING GAS IGNITED.  BOTH MEN EXITED THE EXCAVATION AND WERE NOT INJURED BY THE IGNITION OR THE ENSUING GAS FED FIRE.  THE THREE REGULATOR STATIONS SUPPLYING THE AFFECTED AREA WERE TURNED OFF AND THE RESIDUAL GAS BURNED OFF.  APPROXIMATELY 385 GAS SERVICES WERE INTERRUPTED.  OVERHEAD ELECTRIC FACILITIES IN THE AREA WERE DE-ENERGIZED INTERRUPTING APPROXIMATELY 650 SERVICES.  ELECTRIC SERVICE WAS RESTORED AT APPROXIMATELY 20:40 THAT EVENING.  GAS CONSTRUCTION INSTALLED COMPRESSION CAPS ON THE 12 INCH OPEN ENDS AND A WOODEN PLUG IN THE DEAD 4 INCH MAIN.

MICHAEL CLARK OF THE RESIDENCE HAD JUST ENTERED HIS GARAGE AT THE TIME OF THE EXPLOSION.  THE SOURCE OF IGNITION HAS NOT BEEN DETERMINED, HOWEVER IT HAS BEEN SPECULATED THAT HE WAS ENTERING THE GARAGE TO SMOKE A CIGARETTE.  TWO OTHER RESIDENTS WERE HOME AT THE TIME OF THE EXPLOSION AND FIRE, DAKNEEKA PALMER, THE FIANCE OF MICHAEL CLARK, AND THEIR 9-MONTH-OLD DAUGHTER, LEGACEE.  BOTH ESCAPED THE HOUSE UNHARMED.  THE ENERGY COOP WAS CONTACTED BY THE LICKING COUNTY 911 DISPATCHER AT 01:34 (5/14/12 - 1 HOUR 41 MINUTES AFTER THE EXPLOSION) TO RESPOND TO THE SITE TO ENSURE GAS WAS OFF TO THE STRUCTURE.  TWO ENERGY COOP EMPLOYEES WERE DISPATCHES, A LEAKAGE INSPECTOR MICHAEL CARR AND A SERVICE TECH TOM COOPER.  TOM ARRIVED 02:05 AND MIKE ARRIVED AT 02:20.  THEY VERIFIED GAS WAS OFF AND BEGAN A LEAKAGE INVESTIGATION.  AT 3:05, A LEAK WAS FOUND UNDER THE 20' WIDE APPROACH APRON OF THE DRIVEWAY AT 36 S. UTAH.  THE LEAKAGE EXTENTS WERE IDENTIFIED AND THE DECISION TO SHUT THE MAIN DOWN ALONG WITH 8 CUSTOMERS WAS MADE.  THE VALVE TO SHUT THE LINE DOWN WAS TURNED AT 05:26 HOURS.  THE 2"" MAIN LINE SERVICING THE AREA WAS EXCAVATED AND CUT ON THE NORTH END AND SOUTH END OUTSIDE OF THE LEAKAGE AREA.  APPROXIMATELY 250' OF 2"" PLASTIC MAIN LINE WAS INSTALLED ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF UTAH AVENUE.  THE NEW LINE WAS TIE BACK INTO THE EXISTING LINE IN A MANNER THAT ISOLATED THE GAS MAIN IN THE LEAKAGE AREA.  THE OLD LINE WAS CAPPED TO PRESERVE THE LINE FOR FURTHER TESTING.  GAS SERVICE WAS REESTABLISHED TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD.  ODORANT READINGS WERE TAKEN AND FOUND TO BE WELL WITHIN REQUIRED LIMITS.  THE REMAINDER OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD WAS SURVEYED FOR LEAKAGE TO ENSURE THE AREA WAS SAFE AS IT RELATED TO GAS SERVICE.  AT 09:00 ON MAY 16TH , 2012 WE RETURNED TO THE SITE TO PERFORM AN INVESTIGATION.  WE PRESSURE TESTED THE ISOLATED MAIN LINE AT NORMAL OPERATING PRESSURE (43#) TO TEST FOR LEAKAGE.  WE FOUND LEAKAGE ON THE ISOLATED 191' OF 2"" BARE STEEL.  WE ISOLATED APPROXIMATELY 90' NORTH OF THE 36 S. UTAH DRIVEWAY AND PRESSURE TESTED IT.  WE FOUND NO LEAKAGE.  WE TESTED THE SOUTHERN SECTION (APPROXIMATELY 100') AND FOUND LEAKAGE.  WE EXCAVATED TO EXPOSE THE MAIN LINE JUST SOUTH OF THE DRIVEWAY TO 36 S. UTAH AND CUT THE MAIN TO ISOLATE APROXIMATELY 45' THAT WAS UNDER THE DRIVE WAY.  WE PRESSURE TESTED THE 65'SECTION SOUTH OF THE DRIVEWAY AND FOUND NO LEAKAGE.  WE PRESSURE TESTED THE SERVICE LINE ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE STRUCTURE AND FOUND NO LEAKAGE.  THIS ISOLATED THE LEAKAGE TO THE 45' SECTION LOCATED UNDER THE DRIVEWAY.  WE CUT THE CONCRETE AND PUT PRESSURE ON THE PIPING AND DETERMINED THERE WERE 2 LEAKAGE AREAS APPROXIMATELY 12' APPART UNDER THE EXISTING 20' CONCRETE DRIVEWAY."

IT WAS THEN DETERMINED THAT IT APPEARD THAT THERE WAS A POTENTIAL OF A NATURAL GAS EXPLOSION/IGNITION THAT CONTRIBUTED TO THIS INCIDENT/LOSS. THE EXACT CAUSE OF THE IGNITION SOURCE OR THE AREA WHERE GAS MAY HAVE BEEN RELEASED HAS NOT BEEN DETERMINED AS OF YET. ON 3/14/12 THERE WILL BE A COMBINED INVESTIGATION WITH SEVERAL PARTIES OF INTEREST TO TRY AND LOCATE THE ORIGIN OF THE LEAK AND OR THE CAUSE OF THE LOSS.      10/11/12- OUR INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT THE COCK VALVE ON THE INSIDE OF THE DWELLING HAD A LEAK IN THE PACKING AND THE GAS ESCAPED THE COCK VALVE AND MIGRATED TOWARDS THE FURNACE AREA OF THE DWELLING. DUE TO THE HOUSE BEING VACANT AND VENELATION WAS MINIMAL THERE ENDED UP BEING A BUILD UP IN THE FURNACE AREA AND WHEN THE FURNACE CYCLED IT IGNITED THE GAS AND THE RESULT OF THIS IGNITION WAS THE LOSS OF THIS DWELLING. THE GAS SERVICE TO THE DWELLING WAS ABANDONED AT THE MAIN ON THE DAY OF THE LOSS AND THE DWELLING SINCE HAS BEEN TORN DOWN DUE TO THE LOSS.    10/22/12- THE INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT ON THE UPSTREAM SIDE OF THE INSIDE METER, THE OPERATOR OWNED COCK VALVE LEAKED IN THE PACKING AND RELEASED NATURAL GAS INTO THE ATMOSPHERE. THE NATURAL GAS THAT WAS RELEASED, WHICH WAS THE FUEL SOURCE,IGNITED WHEN THE FURNACE CYCLED AND THE RESULT WAS THE LOSS THAT WAS BEEN REPORTED.  OUR INVESTIGATION IS CLOSED IN REGARD TO THIS MATTER AND THIS ENTRY SHALL SERVE AS OUR FINAL ENTRY IN REGARD TO THIS MATTER.     11/10/14- MUD HAS CONTINUED ITS INVESTIGATION INTO THE CAUSE OF THE EXPLOSION AND FIRE AND, AS A RESULT, NOW DRAWS A DIFFERENT CONCLUSION THAN PREVIOUSLY ENTERED ON THIS REPORT. AS A RESULT OF THIS CONTINUED INVESTIGATION, MUD BELIEVES THAT THE PRIMARY GAS SOURCE THAT CAUSED THE EXPLOSION AND SUBSEQUENT FIRE WAS THE INLET SWIVEL AND NOT THE GAS COCK VALVE. THIS CONCLUSION IS BASED UPON THE CONDITION OF THE METER, THE DESCRIPTIONS OF THE FIRE WHEN THE FIRE DEPARTMENT AND MUD PERSONAL ARRIVED ON SCENE AND MUD EMPLOYEE'S EXPERIENCE AND KNOWLEDGE OF GAS AND GAS DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS. MUD BELIEVES THAT THE ONLY WAY THE INLET SWIVEL COULD HAVE HAVE BEEN THE CAUSE OF THE LEAK WAS FOR THE INLET SWIVEL TO HAVE BEEN INTENTIONALLY LOOSENED FROM THE GAS METER.

VECTREN PERSONNEL WERE DISPATCHED TO THE SCENE AND SUBSEQUENTLY CLOSED THE VALVE TO THE SERVICE LINE PROVIDING NATURAL GAS TO THE STRUCTURE.     AN INITIAL REPORT FROM THE FAIRBORN FIRE DEPARTMENT INDICATED THE STRUCTURE INVOLVED IN THE INCIDENT WAS 'TOTALLY DESTROYED AND REDUCED TO A FLAMING PILE OF RUBBLE'.  IT FURTHER DESCRIBED THE DAMAGE TO ADJACENT STRUCTURES INCLUDING BLOWN OUT WINDOWS, A COLLAPSED EXTERIOR WALL AND SMALL AMOUNTS OF FIRE TO THE ROOF LINES.     THE INITIAL REPORT ALSO COMMENTED THAT ALTHOUGH THE CAUSE REMAINS UNDER INVESTIGATION, THE PRELIMINARY THOUGHT IS THAT 'EXCAVATION WORK AROUND A NATURAL GAS LINE CAUSED THE LINE TO FRACTURE ON THE INSIDE OF THE BASEMENT WALL'' 'ALLOWING THE FREE FLOW OF GAS TO FILL THE INTERIOR OF THE STRUCTURE AND A UNDETERMINED IGNITION SOURCE SPARKED THE EXPLOSION.'    VECTREN IS CONTINUING ITS OWN INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION INTO THE ORIGIN OF THIS INCIDENT.    SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT NARRATIVE, JANUARY 10, 2012:    THE NATURAL GAS SERVICE LINE FOR THE DUPLEX AT 367-369 WAYNE DRIVE RAN UNDERGROUND FROM THE CURB BOX THROUGH THE CONCRETE BASEMENT WALL INTO THE BASEMENT OF 367 WAYNE DRIVE.  AFTER GOING STRAIGHT THROUGH THE BASEMENT WALL, THE NATURAL GAS SERVICE LINE THEN WENT TO THE LEFT AT A TEE CONNECTION TO THE METER FOR 367 WAYNE DRIVE AND THEN TO THE RIGHT AT AN NINETY DEGREE ELBOW THROUGH THE BLOCK WALL, DIVIDING THE BASEMENTS, TO THE METER FOR 369 WAYNE DRIVE.      VECTREN GENERALLY CONCLUDES THAT THE BACKHOE OPERATOR, DIGGING A TRENCH OUTSIDE THE BASEMENT FOUNDATION BETWEEN THE SIDEWALK AND THE DUPLEX, DAMAGED THE NATURAL GAS SERVICE LINE.  THIS DAMAGE CAUSED THE NATURAL GAS SERVICE LINE TO BEND AND PULL AND TO PLACE A LARGE AMOUNT OF TENSION ON THE GAS SERVICE LINE AND THE THREADS THAT SCREWED INTO THE NINETY DEGREE ELBOW INSIDE THE BASEMENT OF 367 WAYNE DRIVE.  THIS LARGE AMOUNT OF TENSION CAUSED THE THREADS OF THE GAS SERVICE LINE, WHICH WERE SCREWED INTO THE NINETY DEGREE ELBOW, TO FRACTURE AT THIS THREAD JOINT RELEASING NATURAL GAS INTO THE BASEMENT OF 367 WAYNE DRIVE.  THE NATURAL GAS EXPLODED FROM AN UNDETERMINED IGNITION SOURCE ONCE THE NATURAL GAS AND AIR MIXTURE HAD REACHED A POINT BETWEEN THE LOWER EXPLOSIVE LIMIT AND THE UPPER EXPLOSIVE LIMIT.  THE FORCE OF THE EXPLOSION DID NOT CAUSE THE FRACTURE TO THIS THREAD JOINT.      VECTREN'S INVESTIGATION ALSO DETERMINED THAT THE PROPER AMOUNT OF MERCAPTAN OR ODORANT WAS IN THE NATURAL GAS AT THE TIME AND THAT THERE WERE NO OTHER NATURAL GAS LEAKS.  THE SERVICE LINE WAS IN GOOD CONDITION AND LEAK TIGHT.  VECTREN'S INVESTIGATION ALSO DETERMINED THAT THERE WERE NO REQUESTS TO LOCATE THE NATURAL GAS SERVICE LINE BEFORE THESE UNFORTUNATE EVENTS AND THAT THERE WAS NO REQUEST TO TURN OFF THE NATURAL GAS.  ALTHOUGH VECTREN DOES NOT RELY ON THE INITIAL REPORT OF THE FAIRBORN FIRE DEPARTMENT OR THE INCIDENT REPORT AND SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT OF THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL, VECTREN'S CONCLUSIONS ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE FACTS CONTAINED IN THESE REPORTS."

THE PURPOSE OF THE PROCEDURE WAS TO DISPOSE OF A BUILD-UP OF NATURAL GAS (DETERMINED LATER TO HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN A MIXTURE OR AIR AND GAS) IN THE 22-INCH PIPELINE BY TRANSFERRING IT AT 10 PSIG INTO MICHCON'S GRAND RAPIDS/WALKER DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM RATHER THAN RELEASING IT TO THE ATMOSPHERE AND FLARING (BURNING) THE GAS.  THE PROCEDURE WAS EXECUTED PRECISELY AS WRITTEN AND APPROVED BY MICHCON ENGINEERING.    AT APPROXIMATELY 10:15 AM, WHILE THE PRESSURE REDUCTION PROCEDURE WAS STILL IN PROGRESS, MICHCON BEGAN TO RECEIVE ""NO-GAS"" REPORTS FROM CUSTOMERS SERVED BY THE SURROUNDING 10 PSIG DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM. AT APPROXIMATELY 11:00 AM, MICHCON PERSONNEL REALIZED THERE HAD BEEN AN AIR AND GAS MIXTURE IN THE 22-INCH PIPELINE, RATHER THAN GAS.  PRESSURE REDUCTION OPERATIONS WERE HALTED IMMEDIATELY.    MICHCON ENGINEERING AND OPERATIONS PERSONNEL IMMEDIATELY CONVENED TO DETERMINE THE EXTENT OF THE AFFECTED AREA AND THE SOURCE OF THE AIR/GAS MIXTURE.  MICHCON DETERMINED THAT APPROXIMATELY 5500 CUSTOMERS OVER AN AREA OF ABOUT 10 SQUARE MILES COULD ULTIMATELY BE AFFECTED.  HOWEVER, BETWEEN THE INITIAL OUTAGE REPORTS AT 10:15 AM AND THE EARLY AFTERNOON OF OCTOBER 17, THERE WERE ONLY ABOUT 100 ""NO-GAS"" REPORTS.  THIS NUMBER GREW TO APPROXIMATELY 350 OUTAGE REPORTS BY 8 PM AS CUSTOMERS RETURNED HOME AT THE END OF THE DAY.  AT 8 PM MICHCON MANAGEMENT DECLARED THIS A ""SIGNIFICANT EVENT"" AND A TELEPHONIC REPORT WAS MADE TO THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER.     CREWS WERE MOBILIZED FROM MICHCON REGIONS ACROSS THE STATE OF MICHIGAN TO MAKE A DOOR-TO-DOOR INVESTIGATION OF EVERY CUSTOMER PREMISES IN THE AFFECTED AREA TO ENSURE THAT GAS SERVICE WAS BEING RESTORED AND THAT ALL APPLIANCES WERE OPERATING PROPERLY.  MICHCON ENGINEERS DEVELOPED A PLAN TO SYSTEMATICALLY PURGE THE AIR/GAS MIXTURE FROM THE 10 PSIG DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM, AND INDIVIDUAL SERVICE LINES WERE PURGED OF THE AIR/GAS MIXTURE WHEREVER IT WAS FOUND.  BY FRIDAY, OCTOBER 21, 2011, EVERY CUSTOMER HAD EITHER BEEN CONTACTED OR THEIR PREMISES WERE ENTERED WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND LOCKSMITHS TO CONFIRM THAT GAS SERVICE HAD BEEN RESTORED.  THERE WERE NO FIRES, EXPLOSIONS, OR INJURIES REPORTED AS A RESULT OF THIS EVENT.    MICHCON HAS DETERMINED THE FORMATION OF THE AIR/GAS MIXTURE INSIDE THE 2.5-MILE SECTION OF THE 22-INCH 238 PSIG PIPELINE BEGAN ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE SEGMENT WAS TAKEN OUT OF SERVICE DURING AUGUST 2011.  THE 22-INCH PIPELINE HAD BEEN SHUT IN BETWEEN MICHCON'S SOUTH GRAND RAPIDS GATE STATION TO THE WEST AND THE NEW COLLINDALE REGULATING STATION ON THE EAST END OF THE 22-INCH PIPELINE SEGMENT.  THE 2.5-MILE SECTION OF PIPELINE HAD BEEN EVACUATED AND PURGED OF GAS, THEN CAPPED OFF AT THE COLLINDALE REGULATING STATION SITE WHILE CONSTRUCTION OF THE STATION WAS COMPLETED.     A 22-INCH BLOCK VALVE AT THE SOUTH GRAND RAPIDS GATE STATION THAT WAS USED TO ISOLATE THE WEST END OF THE 2.5-MILE SECTION OF 22-INCH PIPELINE ALLOWED GAS TO SLOWLY BLEED PAST THE VALVE SEAT, MIXING WITH THE AIR LEFT IN THE PURGED SECTION OF 22-INCH PIPELINE DURING THE PERIOD BETWEEN AUGUST AND OCTOBER 2011.  THE MICHCON ENGINEER WHO DEVELOPED THE WRITTEN PROCEDURE FOR OCTOBER 17 RECOGNIZED THAT THE GAS BLEEDING THROUGH THE 22-INCH BLOCK VALVE WAS CREATING A PRESSURE BUILD-UP, BUT FAILED TO RECOGNIZE THIS WOULD CREATE AN AIR/GAS MIXTURE THAT WOULD BE UNFIT FOR DISTRIBUTION TO CUSTOMERS.    MICHCON HAS DETERMINED APPROXIMATELY 136,000 CUBIC FEET OF AN AIR/GAS MIXTURE HAD ACCUMULATED IN THE 2.5-MILE SECTION OF 22-INCH PIPELINE.  A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THIS MIXTURE WAS INTRODUCED INTO THE SURROUNDING 10 PSIG DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM DURING THE PROCEDURE EXECUTED ON OCTOBER 17, 2011, RESULTING IN THE CUSTOMER OUTAGES."

THE CREW CONSISTED OF A DISTRIBUTION GENERAL FITTER AND A SERVICE TECHNICIAN. THE CREW EXCAVATED AND EXPOSED A 6-INCH CAST IRON DISTRIBUTION MAIN OPERATING AT 5 PSIG.  THE DISTRIBUTION GENERAL FITTER, WHILE WEARING A SUPPLIED AIR-RESPIRATOR, PREPARED THE CAST IRON MAIN FOR INSTALLATION OF A 6-INCH BY 9-INCHES IN LENGTH PIPE REPAIR CLAMP.  THE DISTRIBUTION GENERAL FITTER INSTALLED THE CLAMP AND TIGHTENED THE BOLTS TO STOP THE LEAK.  THE DISTRIBUTION GENERAL FITTER REMOVED THE SUPPLIED AIR-RESPIRATOR FOR UNKNOWN REASONS. THEREAFTER, HE PROCEEDED TO FINISH TIGHTENING THE BOLTS AND SOAP CHECK THE PIPE TO VERIFY THAT THE LEAK WAS STOPPED.  AT THAT TIME, THE SERVICE TECHNICIAN LEFT THE TOP OF THE EXCAVATION AND WENT TO THE TRUCK TO RETRIEVE COATING FOR THE REPAIR CLAMP WHEN HE HEARD THE SOUND OF GAS BLOWING FROM THE EXCAVATION.  THE SERVICE TECHNICIAN IMMEDIATELY RETURNED TO THE EXCAVATION AND FOUND THE DISTRIBUTION GENERAL FITTER KNEELING FACE DOWN OVER THE GAS MAIN AND UNRESPONSIVE TO VERBAL COMMANDS.  THE SERVICE TECHNICIAN ATTEMPTED TO RETRIEVE THE DISTRIBUTION GENERAL FITTER FROM THE EXCAVATION BUT WAS UNABLE TO DO SO AND CALLED 911.  GROSSE POINTE FARMS POLICE AND EMS PERSONNEL RESPONDED TO THE SCENE AND PULLED THE DISTRIBUTION GENERAL FITTER FROM THE EXCAVATION; HE WAS TRANSFERRED TO ST. JOHN'S HOSPITAL IN DETROIT, MI WHERE HE WAS PRONOUNCED DEAD.  A SECOND REPAIR CREW WAS CALLED IN TO REPAIR THE GAS MAIN FOLLOWING THE INCIDENT AND INSTALLED A 6-INCH BY 12-INCHES IN LENGTH REPAIR CLAMP ADJACENT TO THE FIRST REPAIR CLAMP;  HOWEVER THE CLAMP FURTHER CRUSHED THE CORRODED/WEAKENED PIPE.   BOTH REPAIR CLAMPS WERE REMOVED AND A 6-INCH BY 30-INCHES IN LENGTH REPAIR CLAMP WAS INSTALLED TO REPAIR THE LEAK.     ON NOVEMBER 1, 2011, THE PIPE WAS REMOVED AND RECOVERED FOR EXAMINATION AND A METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS BY A THIRD PARTY LABORATORY.  THE ANALYSIS CONCLUDED THAT LOCALIZED GRAPHITIC CORROSION WEAKENED THE FRACTURED PIECES OF PIPE THAT WERE CRUSHED WHEN TIGHTENING THE REPAIR CLAMPS."

THE AREA WAS MADE SAFE AND REPAIRS WERE MADE.  INVESTIGATION DETERMINED THAT THE LEAK WAS CAUSED BY A CRACKED SERVICE TEE CAP.  SUBSEQUENT AERATION ACTIVITIES WERE PERFORMED TO REMOVE THE NATURAL GAS FROM THE SOIL.  THE AERATION COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS LEAK EXCEEDED THE INCIDENT REPORTING THRESHOLD OF $50,000 ON NOVEMBER 17, 2011.      THE MANUFACTURER INSTALLATION PROCEDURES FOR THE CRACKED SERVICE TEE CAP STATE THAT THESE TYPES OF CAPS ARE DESIGNED TO BE HAND TIGHTENED ONLY.  THE CRACKED CAP FROM THIS FAILURE HAS WRENCH MARKS.  BASED ON THIS EVIDENCE, WE CONCLUDE THAT THE CAP FAILURE WAS MOST LIKELY CAUSED BY OVER TIGHTENING OF THE CAP."

EXCAVATION OF THE PLASTIC GAS DISTRIBUTION MAIN REVEALED A CRACK IN A 2-INCH ALDYL A PLASTIC TEE, WHICH WAS THE SOURCE OF THE GAS LEAK.  THE TEE FAILED AS A RESULT OF STRESS RISERS FORMED IN THE TEE MATERIAL FROM THE STEPWISE INCREASE IN WALL THICKNESS WHERE THE COUPLING AND SERVICE PIPE FIRST BOND.  THE FRACTURE PROPOGATED BY SLOW CRACK GROWTH DRIVEN BY THE SYSTEM PRESSURE.  GAS FROM THE LEAKING TEE MIGRATED UNDERGROUND TO THE GARAGE OF THE RESIDENCE AND CAUGHT FIRE FROM THE PILOT LIGHT OF THE FURNACE IN THE GARAGE.

HOWEVER, THE EXCAVATOR WAS ABLE TO HAND DIG AND LOCATE THE MAIN AS REQUIRED.  THE EXCAVATOR THEN PROCEEDED TO USE A BACKHOE TO EXCAVATE A TRENCH PARALLEL TO BUT NOT ADJACENT TO THE MAIN WITHOUT FURTHER EXPOSING THE GAS PIPE.    THE ROOT CAUSE WAS THE EXCAVATOR'S FAILURE TO ADEQUATELY PROBE FOR THE MAIN AND APPURTENANCES AS HE PROGRESSED AWAY FROM THE ORIGINAL EXPOSED SECTION IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THE MAIN.  NEW JERSEY CODE REQUIRES PROPER CARE AND ADEQUATE SUPERVISION BE USED TO AVOID DAMAGE TO THE UNDERGROUND FACILITY AFTER LOCATING THE FACILITY BY HAND (REF. N.J.A.C.14-2-3.3).  THE CLOSE PROXIMITY AND STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY OF THE DAMAGED FACILITY SUGGESTS NO CLOSE SUPERVISION OF THE MECHANICAL EXCAVATION WAS BEING PRACTICED ALTHOUGH THE EXCAVATOR KNEW THE EXCAVATION WAS BEING PERFORMED WITHIN INCHES OF THE GAS MAIN AND ITS LIKELY APPURTENANCES.

THE STATION EQUIPMENT HAS BEEN TAKEN TO THE GAS TECHNOLOGY INSTITUTE (GTI) FOR FURTHER EXAMINATION AND INVESTIGATION.    AFTER GTI REMOVED AN OILY SUBSTANCE AND CLEANED THE COMPONENTS WITH ISOPROPYL ALCOHOL, THE REGULATORS INVOLVED IN THE INCIDENT WERE TESTED IN JUNE AND AUGUST WITH ALL OTHER INTERESTED PARTIES PRESENT.  THE REGULATING EQUIPMENT WAS DETERMINED TO FUNCTION AS DESIGNED DURING INCREASING AND DECREASING FLOW AND PRESSURE CONDITIONS.  THE REGULATING EQUIPMENT WAS FOUND TO OPERATE PROPERLY WITH THE FLUIDS REMOVED.  IT IS CURRENTLY BELIEVED THAT THE PRESENCE OF PIPELINE FLUIDS AND GAS TEMPERATURE DROP ACROSS THE REGULATORS CAUSED THE REGULATORS TO MALFUNCTION."

COLUMBIA PERSONNEL ARRIVED AND FOUND COLUMBIA'S DISTRICT REGULATOR STATION, R-316, MANHATTAN BLVD & SUDER AV., ON FIRE.  COLUMBIA CREWS OPERATED VALVES TO SHUT IN THE STATION FOR SAFETY.  DISTRICT STATION, R-316, CONTINUES TO BE OUT OF COMMISSION. A TEMPORARY REGULATOR STATION HAS BEEN INSTALLED TO ENSURE SAFE, RELIABLE SERVICE TO CUSTOMERS DURING WINTER OPERATIONS.   CURRENTLY SERVICE HAS BEEN RESTORED TO ALL CUSTOMERS.     COLUMBIA'S CAUSE AND ORIGIN INVESTIGATORS HAVE CONCLUDED THAT THE CAUSE OF THIS FIRE WAS THE RESULT OF A CROSS ARM FAILURE FROM OUR ELECTRICAL PROVIDER'S NEARBY POWER POLE.  THE HIGH VOLTAGE PRIMARY CONDUCTORS (LINES) FELL INTO THE SECONDARY ELECTRICAL DROP SERVING COLUMBIA'S REGULATOR STATION BUILDING AND ENERGIZED THE NEUTRAL TO 7200 VOLTS.  THIS RESULTED IN A FAULT CURRENT THAT TRAVELED VIA ALL AVAILABLE GROUND PATHS TO STAINLESS STEEL CONTROL LINES LOCATED INSIDE THE STATION.  THE SUBSEQUENT ELECTRICAL ARCING RESULTED IN HOLES BEING BURNED IN THE STAINLESS STEEL CONTROL LINES WHICH RELEASED GAS THAT WAS IGNITED BY THE ELECTRICAL ARCING, RESULTING IN THE INITIAL PHASE OF THIS FIRE.      ONCE THE GAS-FED FIRE IGNITED WITHIN THE REGULATOR STATION FROM THE ELECTRICALLY DAMAGED STAINLESS STEEL CONTROL LINES AND CONTROL BOX, THE FIRE FROM THE CONTROL LINES BURNED THE GASKETS OUT OF THE LARGE DIAMETER PIPE FLANGES AND A MUCH LARGER FIRE  ENSUED FED BY THE 130 PSIG GAS.  THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH EYE WITNESS ACCOUNTS THAT THE FIRE THAT DAMAGED THE REGULATOR BUILDING DID NOT START UNTIL 20 TO 30 MINUTES AFTER THE POWER LINES CAME DOWN"

AT APPROXIMATELY 8:48 AM CST, INTERSTATE POWER & LIGHT'S (IPL) DISTRIBUTION DISPATCH CENTER IN CEDAR RAPIDS, IA RECEIVED A CALL FROM EMPLOYEES IN IPL'S CENTERVILLE CALL CENTER WITH A REPORT OF AN ELECTRICAL OUTAGE AND A HOUSE FIRE ACROSS THE STREET FROM THE CALL CENTER BUILDING.  AN ELECTRIC LINEMAN WAS DISPATCHED TO INVESTIGATE.  AT APPROXIMATELY 9:05 AM, A CALL ALSO CAME IN FROM THE CENTERVILLE POLICE/FIRE DISPATCHER REPORTING A HOUSE FIRE. WHEN THE IPL LINEMAN ARRIVED ONSITE AT 9:20 AM, THE VALVE AT THE GAS METER SET HAD BEEN SHUT OFF BY FIRE DEPARTMENT PERSONNEL.  AT THIS POINT, THE SITUATION APPEARED TO BE A HOUSE FIRE CAUSED BY A SQUIRREL MAKING CONTACT WITH AN ENERGIZED SWITCH ON A POLE AT THE REAR OF 1202 DRAKE AVENUE, WHICH RESULTED IN A FAULT AND BREAKER OPERATIONS THAT INTRODUCED HIGH VOLTAGE ELECTRICITY INTO THE HOME'S ELECTRICAL WIRING SYSTEM.       AT APPROXIMATELY 9:25 AM, DURING FIREFIGHTING ACTIVITIES, A ""WHOOSH"" OR ""FLASH"" OCCURRED, INDICATING AN IGNITION OF GAS.  AT THIS POINT, FLAMES ALSO APPEARED ALONG THE GROUND NEAR THE HOUSE.

AN IOWA UTILITIES BOARD INVESTIGATOR, ALONG WITH A STATE FIRE INVESTIGATOR, VISITED THE SITE ON THE AFTERNOON OF MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 27, 2010 AND WITNESSED THE EXCAVATION AND REMOVAL OF A SEGMENT OF THE SERVICE LINE.  INITIAL INDICATIONS ARE THAT AN ELECTRICAL ARC BETWEEN THE ELECTRICAL SERVICE LINE CONDUIT AND THE STEEL GAS SERVICE BURNED A HOLE IN BOTH, ALLOWING GAS TO MIGRATE INTO THE ALREADY BURNING STRUCTURE VIA THE CONDUIT AND INTO THE ELECTRIC SERVICE PANEL.  THE SOURCE OF IGNITION WOULD APPEAR TO BE THE EXISTING FIRE IN THE STRUCTURE.

THE CALL WAS RECEIVED AT APPROXIMATELY 10:30AM BY AMANDA BRIDGES. SHE DISPATCHED THE INFORMATION TO THE GAS DEPARTMENT FOR INVESTIGATION.  JAMES YOUNG, BRUCE BURGESS, BUSTER FELTON, AND MARIO BYRD PERFORMED THE INITIAL INVESTIGATION AT KEITH-A-QUE, WHICH IS LOCATED AT 249 EAST WASHINGTON AVE. DURING THEIR INVESTIGATION GAS PERSONNEL DETERMINED THAT ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL WERE NEEDED TO DETERMINE THE CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM. ASHBURN GAS SUPERINTENDENT ROGER GIDDENS REPORTED TO THEIR LOCATION AT APPROXIMATELY 11:00AM TO HELP DETERMINE THE SOURCE OF THE PROBLEM. DURING THE INVESTIGATION OTHER LOCATIONS THROUGHOUT TOWN REPORTED HAVING SIMILAR PROBLEMS. PROPANE ODOR WAS DETERMINED TO BE PRESENT WITHIN THE NATURAL GAS SYSTEM.   AT APPROXIMATELY 12:00PM CITY PERSONNEL DETERMINED THAT PROPANE WAS BEING INTRODUCED INTO THE NATURAL GAS SYSTEM FROM FOUR 500 GALLON PROPANE TANKS CONNECTED TO A FUEL LINE AT THE HAT CREEK PEANUT COMPANY INC. LOCATED AT 465 BUSSEY ROAD, SYCAMORE GA. 31790.  LATER INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT THIS METERED SERVICE WAS DELIVERING LINE PRESSURE TO THE HAT CREEK PER AGREEMENT BETWEEN ASHBURN AND HAT CREEK.  HAT CREEK CONNECTED THE PROPANE TANKS TO ITS INTERNAL PIPING IN AN ATTEMPT TO SUPPLEMENT ITS NATURAL GAS SUPPLY DURING HIGH DEMAND PERIODS.  THE ABSENCE OF A SERVICE REGULATOR AT THE METER ALLOWED THE HIGHER-PRESSURE PROPANE TO FLOW BACKWARD THROUGH THE METER INTO ASHBURN'S NATURAL GAS FACILITIES.  GEORGIA PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION (GPSC) INSPECTORS JOSH LAIRSEY AND ROB PACER WERE NOTIFIED OF THE EVENT AT APPROXIMATELY 1:45PM ON SEPTEMBER 24, 2010.   ASHBURN CITY MANAGER BEN TAYLOR ESTABLISHED A COMMAND CENTER AT CITY HALL TO DEVELOP A PLAN OF ACTION WITH ALL CITY PERSONNEL. DUE TO THE UNKNOWN VOLUME AND EXTENT OF PROPANE IN THE NATURAL GAS SYSTEM, CITY PERSONNEL DECIDED TO BEGIN SHUTTING OFF ALL SERVICES THROUGHOUT THE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM. MUTUAL ASSISTANCE WAS REQUESTED FROM AND PROVIDED BY THE CITIES OF DOUGLAS, TIFTON, CORDELE, SYLVESTER AND FITZGERALD.  ASHBURN CONFIRMED THAT THESE CITIES' PERSONNEL HAVE APPROPRIATE OPERATOR QUALIFICATIONS TO PERFORM THE REQUESTED TASK. THE SHUT OFF PROCESS BEGAN AT APPROXIMATELY 4:00PM ON FRIDAY SEPTEMBER 24TH, 2010.  ACTING ON INSTRUCTIONS FROM GPSC TO REPORT THIS EVENT TO THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER (NRC) AS AN INCIDENT PURSUANT TO 49 CFR PART 191, BEN TAYLOR REQUESTED THAT THE SUBSCRIBED REGULATORY COMPLIANCE SERVICE (SRCS) MAKE THE TELEPHONIC REPORT ON BEHALF OF ASHBURN.   ON 9/24/2010 AT 3:16PM, SRCS MANAGER BILL DEFOOR CALLED THE NRC AND GAVE THE REQUIRED INFORMATION TO KEVIN WILLIAMS, WHO ASSIGNED CASE #955047 TO THE REPORT.ON 9/24/2010 AT 6:59PM THE VALVE SUPPLYING NATURAL GAS TO THE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM WAS SHUT OFF.  THE SHUTTING OFF AND LOCKING OF ALL SERVICES WAS COMPLETE AT APPROXIMATELY 3:15AM ON 9/25/2010. DURING THE COMPLETION OF THE SHUT-OFF ACTION LINE PRESSURE ON THE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM DROPPED TO ZERO AS HAT CREEK CONSUMED THE REMAINING CONTAMINATED GAS THROUGH ITS PEANUT DRYERS. ON 9/25/2010 AT 9:00AM THE VALVE CONTROLLING THE GAS FLOW TO THE CITY WAS CUT BACK ON. AS A PRECAUTION, LOCATIONS THROUGHOUT THE SYSTEM WERE MONITORED FOR 100% GAS USING (CGI) COMBUSTIBLE GAS INDICATORS. THE LOCATIONS THAT WERE MONITORED WERE INDUSTRIAL BLVD., CENTRAL PACKING PLANT, AND BRIDGES ROAD. WHEN 100% LEVELS WERE CONFIRMED, CREWS BEGAN CUTTING ON SERVICES AND RELIGHTING APPLIANCES THROUGHOUT THE SYSTEM.  THE RELIGHTING PROCESS STARTED AT APPROXIMATELY 10:30AM SATURDAY MORNING.

ON THAT DAY AT 17:15, AVISTA WAS NOTIFIED OF A FIRE AT 825 OAK KNOLL DR. IN ASHLAND, OR (JACKSON COUNTY). THIS WAS REPORTED TO DOT BECAUSE OF THE RELEASE OF GAS COMBINED WITH THE TOTAL COST OF THE INCIDENT BEING IN EXCESS OF $50,000.    AN AVISTA FIRST RESPONDER ARRIVED ON SITE AT 17:30 BUT WAS UNABLE TO GET TO THE HOMES DUE TO THE FIRE. A TWO INCH STEEL DISTRIBUTION MAIN WAS SQUEEZED TO SHUT OFF GAS TO THE AREA AT 21:37, THIS SHUT OFF GAS SERVICE TO EIGHT HOMES. GAS SERVICE WAS RESTORED TO FIVE OF THE HOMES BY 12:29 ON SEPTEMBER 3RD, 2010. THE OTHER THREE SERVICES WERE NOT RESTORED BECAUSE THE HOMES AND THEIR METER SETS WERE DESTROYED IN THE FIRE. NO FURTHER DAMAGE OCCURRED TO OUR SYSTEM AS A RESULT OF THIS INCIDENT.    GAS WAS A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR, BUT NOT THE CAUSE OF THE FIRE. THE CAUSE OF THE BLAZE IS BELIEVED TO BE A GRASS FIRE FROM A NEARBY FIELD. PER THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT; 30-40 HOMES WERE EVACUATED, 11 HOMES WERE DESTROYED, NO FATALITIES OR HOSPITALIZATIONS. THE TOTAL COST OF THE INCIDENT IS ESTIMATED AT $4,405,743 (11 HOMES LOST, WORTH APPROX $400,000 EACH + AVISTA COSTS OF $5,743 FROM PART D). THE COST OF THE REPLACEMENT OF THE HOMES IS AN ESTIMATE BECAUSE THIS IS PRIVATE INFORMATION BETWEEN THE INSURANCE COMPANIES AND THE HOMEOWNERS."

RESPONDING PERSONNEL HAD THE GAS MAIN LEAK UNDER CONTROL BY 0929.     JANUARY 2012 SUPPLEMENT:  BASED UPON THE RESULTS OF A THIRD PARTY ANALYSIS OF THE FAILED SEGMENT OF PIPE, THE CAUSE OF THE TWO-INCH PVC MAIN PIPE LEAK DISCOVERED ON FIRST STREET ON JULY 11, 2010 WAS A PREVIOUS THIRD PARTY'S FAILURE TO EMPLOY PROPER EXCAVATION PRACTICES. SPECIFICALLY, IT IS LIKELY THAT THE PIPE HAD BEEN UNCOVERED DURING A PREVIOUS EXCAVATION AND THAT THE BACKFILL WAS UNLAWFULLY AND INPROPERLY DUMPED BACK IN THE HOLE WITHOUT COMPACTION. THIS LEFT THE PIPE WITHOUT LATERAL SUPPORT FROM THE DOWNWARD LOADING CAUSED BY THE WEIGHT OF THE NON-COMPACTED BACKFILL, AND FROM OTHER POSSIBLE LOADINGS. THIS LED TO EXCESSIVE LONG-TERM DEFORMATION OF THE PIPE, CAUSING PREMATURE FAILURE."

AMERENIP QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES RESPONDED TO THE CALL AND UPON ARRIVAL FOUND THAT THE BUILDING WAS BEING VENTILATED BY THE KEWANEE FIRE DEPARTMENT.      THE AMERENIP GAS FACILITIES WERE INITIALLY INSPECTED AND DISCOVERED THAT A LEAKING DOWNSPOUT WAS DRIPPING ON THE GAS PRESSURE REGULATOR WHICH ICED OVER CAUSING A SUSPECTED HIGHER THAN NORMAL DELIVERY PRESSURE.      UPON FURTHER INVESTIGATION THE DELIVERY PRESSURE WAS CHECKED AND FOUND TO BE 8.9 PSIG TO CUSTOMER APPLIANCES THAT NORMALLY RECEIVE 0.25 PSIG GAS PRESSURE.      THIS HIGHER THAN NORMAL PRESSURE APPARENTLY CAUSED AN IMPROPER OPERATION OF THE A FURNACE AND A SUBSEQUENT GAS IGNITION.

UPON ARRIVAL, THE HOME LOCATED AT 415 SOUTH 100 EAST WAS COMPLETELY DESTROYED, AND NATURAL GAS WAS ESCAPING NEAR THE FOUNDATION OF THE HOME FROM WHERE THE GAS METER ONCE WAS.    THE FORCE OF THE HOME EXPLODING CAUSED THE METER TO BE SEVERED FROM THE SERVICE LINE AND CAUSED THE UNINTENTIONAL RELEASE OF NATURAL GAS.  THE GAS DID NOT IGNITE OR EXPLODE.  THE METER WAS LOCATED APPROXIMATELY TEN FEET FROM THE FOUNDATION OF THE HOME.  THE 3/4 INCH NIPPLE GOING INTO THE REGULATOR HAD FAILED DUE TO THE FORCE OF THE EXPLOSION.    IMMEDIATELY UPON ARRIVAL QUESTAR PERSONNEL PERFORMED TESTS TO CHECK FOR GAS IN THE GROUND AROUND THE DAMAGED HOUSE AND IN THE SEWER MANHOLES.  NO GAS WAS DETECTED IN THE GROUND, IN THE TELEPHONE DUCT WORK OR IN THE SEWER.      QUESTAR PERSONNEL THEN BEGAN TO SECURE THE SITE AND CUT AND CAPPED THE DAMAGE SERVICE LINE.  THE SERVICE LINE WAS LEAK TESTED FROM THE CUT TO THE RISER.  NO LEAKS WERE DETECTED.  THE REMAINDER OF THE SERVICE LINE WAS LEAK TESTED FROM THE CUT TO THE MAIN AND THEN PERMANENTLY RETIRED.  NO LEAKS WERE DETECTED.    ONCE THE DAMAGED SERVICE LINE WAS SECURED ADDITIONAL LEAK SURVEYS WERE CONDUCTED IN THE AREA TO ENSURE THAT THERE WAS NO LEAKING GAS IN THE GENERAL VICINITY.  THE ADDITIONAL LEAK SURVEY INCLUDED ALL SURFACE STREETS, DUCTS, SEWERS, AND GAS LINE LOCATIONS WITHIN A TWO BLOCK LIMIT OF THE DAMAGED HOME.  NO LEAKS WERE DISCOVERED.    THE HOME WAS VACANT AT THE TIME OF THE EXPLOSION.  NO INJURIES OR FATALITIES WERE REPORTED AS A RESULT OF THIS EXPLOSION.    THE CAUSE OF THE EXPLOSION IS STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION AT THIS TIME BY THE PLEASANT GROVE POLICE DEPARTMENT AND UTAH STATE FIRE MARSHALL.    UPDATE:  BASED ON THE TESTING PERFORMED AT THE SITE, THE SOURCE OF THE LEAK IS BELIEVED TO HAVE COME FROM CUSTOMER OWNED PIPING INSIDE THE HOME."

THE GAS SERVICE LINE WAS SHUT-OFF AT APPROXIMATELY 4:30PM. A LEAK SURVEY OF THE MAIN LINES AND SERVICE LINES ON W. 83RD BETWEEN MADISON AND LORAIN REVEALED NO INDICATIONS OF GAS NEAR THE STRUCTURE. A SERVICE LEAK AT 2131 WEST 83RD STREET WAS DETECTED DURING THE LEAK SURVEY. THIS SERVICE LINE WAS REPLACED UPON DISCOVERY.     ON TUESDAY, JANUARY 26TH, 2010 THE SERVICE LINE AT 2022 W. 83RD WAS AIR TESTED AT OPERATING PRESSURE WITH NO PRESSURE LOSS. AN ODOR TEST WAS CONDUCTED AT 2028 WAST 83RD STREET. THE RESULTS OF THIS ODOR TEST REVEALED ODOR LEVELS WELL WITHIN DOT COMPLIANCE LEVELS. OUR INVESTIGATION REVEALED AN ODOR COMPLAINT AT THIS RESIDENCE ON JANUARY 18TH. DOMINION PERSONNEL RESPONDED TO THE CALL AND MET WITH THE CLEVELAND FIRE DEPARTMENT. DOMINION FOUND THE METER DISCONNECTED AND THE METER SHUT-OFF VALVE IN THE HALF OPEN POSITION. THE SHUT-OFF VALVE WAS CLOSED BY THE DOMINION TECHNICIAN AND SECURED WITH A LOCKING DEVICE. THE TECHNICIAN PLACED A 3/4 INCH PLUG IN THE OPEN END OF THE VALVE. THE TECHNICIAN ALSO ATTEMPTED TO CLOSE THE CURB-SLOP VALVE, BUT COULD NOT. THE SERVICE LINE WAS THEN BAR HOLE TESTED UTILIZING A COMBUSTIBLE GAS INDICATOR FROM THE STREET TO THE STRUCTURE.  AS A RESULT.  NO LEAKAGE WAS DISCOVERED. A SECOND ATTEMPT TO CTOSE THE CURB BOX  VALVE ON JANUARY 19TH ENDED WHEN BLOCKAGE WAS DISCOVERED IN THE VALVE BOX. THE VALVE BOX WAS IN THE PROCESS OF BEING SCHEDULED FOR EXCEVATLON AND SHUT OFF BY A CONSTRUCTION CREW AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT.  AN INVESTIGATION OF THE INCIDENT SITE DETERMINED THE CAUSE TO BE ARSON AS APPROXIMATELY 6 INCHES OF SERVICE LINE AND THE METER SHUT-OFF VALVE (WITH LOCKING DEVICE STILL INTACT), DETACHED FROM THE SERVICE LINE, WERE RECOVERED INSIDE THE STRUCTURE."
