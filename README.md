## pipescheme
**[pipescheme](http://pipescheme.com)** is an open source webapp that uses detailed incident reports compiled by the [Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration](http://phmsa.dot.gov) to show leaks, explosions, and other accidents in your neighborhood from 2011 to present. Check out the locations, post a selfie near the site, and learn more about the utility companies behind our pipelines.

**pipescheme** was commissioned by Ryan Fellhauer of Fifth Media in Autumn of 2017.
*Due to recent changes to the [PHMSA](http://phmsa.dot.gov) site, the database can no longer be auto-updated. I'm working on this.*
